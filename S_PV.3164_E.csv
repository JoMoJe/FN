ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
The agenda was adopted.
THE SITUATION IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
The PRESIDENT: I should like to inform the Council that I have
received a letter from the representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina in which
he requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In accordance with the usual pracitce, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Sacirbev (Bosnia and Herzegovina)
took a place at the Council table.
The PRESIDENT: The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on the agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.
Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have
been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:
"""The Security Council notes with appreciation the efforts of the"
international community to alleviate the plight of the civilian
population in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose lives have
been severely affected by the fighting there. The Council has the
highest regard for the efforts of the brave people who have undertaken to

(The President)
deliver urgently needed humanitarian assistance under extremely trying
conditions to the civilian population in the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, in particular, the efforts of the United Nations Protection
Force (UNPROFOR) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR). However, the Council deeply regrets that the situation there
has imposed great limits on the international community in the fulfilment
of its humanitarian mandate.
"""The Council reaffirms its demand that all parties and others"
concerned, in particular Serb paramilitary units, cease and desist
forthwith from all violations of international humanitarian law being
committed in the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
including in particular the deliberate interference with humanitarian
convoys. The Council warns the parties concerned of serious
consequences, in accordance with relevant resolutions of the Security
Council, if they continue to impede the delivery of humanitarian relief
assistance.
"""The Council invites the Secretary-General to keep under continuous"
review the possibility of air-dropping humanitarian assistance to areas
isolated by the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
"""The Council will remain actively seized of the matter."""
The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on the agenda.
The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.
