(The President)
"""The Security Council has noted with grave concern the letter of"
19 July 1993 from the President of the Presidency of the Republic of
Bosnia and Herzegovina addressed to the President of the Security Council
(S/26107, annex) about the Bosnian Serb military offensive in the area of
Mount Igman, close to Sarajevo, a city which has stood for centuries as
an outstanding example of a multicultural, multi-ethnic and
pluri-religious society, which needs to be protected and preserved.
"""The Security Council renews its demand that all hostilities in the"
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina cease and that the parties and others
concerned refrain from any hostile acts. It supports the call from the
Co-Chairmen of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia in
this regard, designed to facilitate the peace talks.
"""The Security Council reaffirms its resolutions 824 (1993) and"
836 (1993), in the first of which the Council declared Sarajevo a safe
area that should be free from armed attacks and any hostile acts, and
from which Bosnian Serb military or paramilitary units should be
withdrawn to a distance wherefrom they cease to constitute a menace to
its security and that of its inhabitants. It condemns the offensive by
the Bosnian Serbs on Mount Igman aimed at further isolating Sarajevo and
escalating the recent unprecedented and unacceptable pressures on the
Government and people of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina before
the forthcoming talks in Geneva. It demands an immediate end to this
offensive and to all attacks on Sarajevo. It also demands an immediate
end to all violations of international humanitarian law'. It demands an
end to the disruption of public utilities (including water, electricity,
fuel and communications) by the Bosnian Serb party and to the blocking

(The President)
of, and interference with, the delivery of humanitarian relief by both
the Bosnian Serb and the Bosnian Croat parties.
"""The Security Council calls on the parties to meet in Geneva under"
the auspices of the Co-Chairmen of the International Conference on the
Former Yugoslavia. It calls on the parties to negotiate in earnest with
the aim of achieving a just and equitable settlement on the basis of the
sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the principles agreed at the
International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia in London on
26 August 1992 and supported by the Council in its statement of
2 September 1992 (S/24510). In particular it reaffirms the
unacceptability of ethnic cleansing, or the acquisition of territory by
the use of force, or any dissolution of the Republic of Bosnia an
Herzegovina.
"""The Security Council emphasizes that it will keep open all options"
"none of which is prejudged or excluded from consideration."""
This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council unde
the symbol S/26134.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on the agenda.
The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.
The meeting rose at 7.50 p.m.
