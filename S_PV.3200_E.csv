TRIBUTE TO THE MEMORY OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
The PRESIDENT? It is with great sorrow that the members of the
Security Council have learned of the sudden passing today of the President of
the Republic of Turkey, His Excellency Mr. Turgut Ozal. President Ozal was
deeply committed to the ideals of the United Nations and the cause of world
peace. His loss will be deeply mourned by the international community. On
behalf of the Security Council, I wish to express profound condolences to the
Government and the people of Turkey and heartfelt sympathy to the bereaved
family.
I now invite members of the Council to stand and observe a minute of
silence.
The members of the Council observed a minute of silence.

S/25624.
In accordance with the decision taken earlier at this meeting, and
following the invitation to Mr. Cyrus Vance, Co-Chairman of the Steering
Committee of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, I now call
on Mr. Vance.
Mr. VANCE: I thank you for giving me the opportunity to address the
Security Council in the grave circumstances prevailing in Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
The Co-Chairmen welcome the Council's swift action in adopting, last
night, the resolution demanding that Srebrenica and its surroundings be
treated as a safe area free from armed attack or other hostile acts. We share
the Council's sense of urgency, and applaud its decision to meet tonight to
act on further measures needed to bring about compliance with the Council's
decisions.
As you are aware, Mr. President, Lord Owen made special arrangements to
be here for the debate scheduled this coming Monday. Events, however, have
moved faster than expected, and he therefore cannot be here for the meeting
tonight. He would have wisned very much to be here with you at this moment,
because he shares, deeply, the sense of anguish that we all feel about the
shocking events in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
S/PV.3200
7
(Mr. Vance)
With respect to the draft resolution now before the Council, let me say
that Lord Owen and I commend it to you wholeheartedly. If the measures
envisaged in it should fail to achieve the desired effect, they should be
followed by additional measures of sterner persuasion. We hope the Council
will adopt the resolution forthwith, and send this very clear message to the
"Bosnian Serb side and its supporters: time is running out; the clock is"
"ticking; and the international community will no longer wait."
In addition, everything possible must be done to bring humanitarian
relief and assistance to the suffering communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
There can be no excuse for obstructing humanitarian convoys. We trust that
there will emerge from these deliberations a renewed commitment to help the
innocent victims of the conflict.
The PRESIDENT: It is my understanding that the Council is ready to
proceed to vote on the draft resolution before it, as orally revised in its
provisional form. If I hear no objection, I shall take it that that is the
case.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
Before putting the draft resolution to the vote, I shall call on those
members of the Council who wish to make statements before the voting.
Mr, MERI-MEE (France) (interpretation from French): My Goverment
took the initiative of today requesting an immediate meeting of the Security
Council on the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which has worsened
dramatically during the last few days.
I therefore welcome the fact that our Council, gathered this' evening, is
preparing to take a decision on the draft resoluti-on produced by my delegation
and a number of its partners in the Council - a text which is designed to
strengthen the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia
S/PV.3200
8
(Mr. Merimee, France)
and Montenegro). We hope that the draft resolution will be adopted in a few
moments. For the international community, this is the right response, at the
right time, to take up the challenge from the Belgrade authorities and the
Serbian elements in Bosnia that they are blatantly supporting.
Some in the Council have asked why we want to act today and not wait for
the last-minute promises to be carried out. The international community has
shown extreme patience and good will. Our Council has seen promise after
promise not kept. By agreeing, as a last concession, to postpone the adoption
of the draft resolution on strengthening sanctions, we were hoping for some
stabilization of the situation on the ground and for progress in negotiating
"the Vance-Owen plan. We see that none of this has happened; quite the"
contrary, the Serbian side has taken advantage of our postponement to take
control of Srebrenica while at the same time rejecting the peace plan. We
think that the Security Council must act by using the means now at its
disposal, namely, that it should vote to strengthen the sanctions.
In the opinion of my Government, the draft resolution is quite
appropriate for the circumstances. After months and months of refusal by the
Serbs to cooperate with the international community, their foot-dragging and
their encroachments in the field, the draft resolution, by strengthening the
provisions of resolution 757 (1992), marks the total economic and financial
isolation of Serbia. My country, with its partners in the Twelve, is prepared
to take immediate steps to make the implementation of the resolution
effective. It is prepared to help establish the necessary controls and is
working with its partners in the Western European Union on setting up
assistance to the countries along the Danube to suspend all river traffic
destined for Serbia.
S/PV.3200
9-10
(Mr, Merimee, France)
"These are not sanctions for sanctions' sake; the draft resolution is part"
of a global political plan. Our Council's support for the Vance-Owen plan
sends a clear signal to the Serbs that there is a path other than conflict
open to them. In this respect, section C of the resolution is something new
and reflects our desire to see the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro) rejoin the international community provided that it fully respects
the relevant United Nations resolutions.	■
In conclusion, I should like to repeat what we were prompted to say on
the adoption of resolution 816 (1993), which makes provision for the use of
force to ensure respect for the no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina. The
Serbian authorities have a clear choice before them: confrontation with the
international community or cooperation and the search for a negotiated
solution. They now have nine days to choose the latter path and avoid our
implementing the measures we have decided to take.
We have heard threatening statements to the effect that the whole of the
Balkans was likely to go up in flames in response to the Security Council's
decisions. The Belgrade authorities must realise that the international
community will not back down. Just as our determination went one step further
with resolution 816 (1993), so today we are not ruling out going even further
if it proves necessary so to do.
S/PV.3200

Mr. VORONTSOV (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian):
The delegation of the Russian Federation continues to assume - and we have
quite clear instructions from Moscow on this score - that the adoption by the
Security Council at this juncture of a resolution to strenghten sanctions
against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is quite untimely.
We of course support all the provisions of part A of the draft resolution
before the Council, under which the Security Council would call upon all sides
to reach a rapid, peaceful solution. We feel that it is important to give the
parties to the conflict the possibility, through international mediation, of
reaching agreement on the Vance-Owen plan and of completing the intensive
negotiations in this regard that are going on at this moment.
At the same time, I should like to remind everyone that on 9 March the
President of the Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, warned that any party that
did not reach agreement would bear responsibility for the bloodshed, with all
the attendant consequences, including possible new decisions by the Security
Council.
For us, it is quite clear that the Security Council should provide one
last chance - which should be used primarily by the Serbian side - for the
achievement of a realistic agreement by, it goes without saying, observing a
cease-fire and refraining from taking any actions that might be regarded as
"""ethnic cleansing"". In the Russian delegation's view, the most reasonable"
approach to this issue would be the observance of the agreement achieved
earlier in the Security Council to delay voting on this draft resolution on
sanctions until 26 April. Since, however, the majority of the members of the
Security Council insist upon an immediate vote, right now, today - although
S/PV.3200
12
(Mr, Vorontsov, Russian
Federation)
the reason for this was not really put foward in a convincing manner - we felt
that it was possible not to hinder the adoption of this decision, in view of
the fact that it will enter into force only nine days after its adoption,
unless, of course, an agreement is signed on the Vance-Owen plan. But we
still have serious misgivings about the possible negative consequences of the
kind of haste we are showing today.
In the light of what I have said, the Russian delegation will abstain in
the voting on the draft resolution before the Council.
Mr, SARDENBERG (Brazil): The Brazilian delegation is ready to vote
in favour of the draft resolution now before the Security Council, which
encompasses many complex issues - some of them of an unprecedented nature. It
is important to underscore that this draft resolution presents three
fundamental aspects.
The first aspect is the support by the Security Council for the peace
plan carefully drafted by the co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the
International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, Secretary Vance and
Lord Owen, to whom we pay our sincere
Security Council should always favour
peaceful and negotiated means for the
entirety, the Vance-Owen plan remains
tribute. We firmly believe that the
the resort to and the exhaustion of the
settlement of disputes. In its
the only alternative and the best chance
to reach a durable solution to the conflict raging in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
That plan deserves the full backing of the Security Council.
The second aspect refers to the strengthening of measures imposed by
earlier resolutions. As a matter of principle, Brazil has always held that
S/PV.3200
13
(Mr, Sardenbercr, Brazil)
action under Chapter VII of the Charter should be taken only in extreme
circumstances. In this case, we are facing a grave deterioration of the
situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including, and in particular, the
humanitarian tragedy that is unfolding in that Member State. It is this
unbearable human drama that justifies such an exceptional course of action.
We are aware that the measures we are about to approve entail in many cases
complex considerations of a legal, economic, financial and administrative
order. While some of those measures can be readily implemented, others may
require the enactment of appropriate enabling national legislation. The
Government of Brazil will take all the necessary steps to put such legislation
in place as soon as possible. It is our understanding that the specific
provisions of paragraph 29 of the draft resolution, as they refer to the
territorial sea of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro),
are of an exceptional nature, related specifically to the situation under
consideration by the Security Council, and cannot be considered as a precedent
that in any way alters or derogates from the regime of coastal-State rights in
this territorial sea, in accordance with the 1982 United Nations Convention on
the Law of the Sea and other relevant norms of international law.
Finally, I wish to point out that my delegation attaches importance to
the third aspect - namely, to the provisions of part C of the draft
resolution, which make it clear that exceptional measures contained in part B
are not irreversible. It is to be hoped that they may in fact soon lead to
the creation of conditions that would permit resort to the review mechanisms
provided for in paragraph 31 of the draft resolution.
S/PV.3200
14
Mr. JESUS (Cape Verde): On behalf of my delegation, I should like
to express our feelings of deep sorrow and our heartfelt condolences on the
passing away today of President Ozal of Turkey.
On many occasions, my country has had the opportunity in the Security
Council of voicing its frustration at the devastating war in Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
For too long the world has been witnessing one of the most tragic and
cruel armed conflicts in modern times. The deep-seated hatred that has fueled
this conflict and the untamed greed for grabbing territory by force, using all
"means - from killing to ""ethnic cleansing"" - have shocked the international"
conscience and raised a wave of universal indignation.
Appeals from all guarters to stop the war have so far gone unheeded.
Scores of resolutions adopted by the Security Council with a view to bringing
an end to this conflict and to the atrocities are still to be observed.
Cease-fire after cease-fire has been broken.
Faced with such a situation, we voted last year for resolution
724 (1992), the sanctions resolution, as a means of helping stop the war. The
measures that we are considering today have the same objective - that is, to
help stop the war. By adopting these measures, the Council is aiming at
securing full compliance with those sanctions so as to play a positive role in
bringing the cruel war to a negotiated end.
It is high time that this war were brought to an end and a negotiated
solution were reached.
My country believes that the peace settlement worked out by the two
co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the
former Yugoslavia is the best chance for a lasting peace in Bosnia and
S/PV.3200
15
(Mr, Jesus, Cape Verde)
Herzegovina. It is perhaps not the ideal plan, but under the circumstances it
is the only realistic one that takes into account the interests of the three
Bosnian parties.
We commend the two Bosnian parties that have signed this peace plan and
appeal to the Bosnian Serbs to do likewise, in the name of peace. ’
S/PV.32OO
16
Mr, YANEZ-BARNUEVO (Spain) (interpretation from Spanish): My
delegation wholeheartedly shares the sentiments of condolence expressed by
you, Sir, on behalf of us all, on the sudden death of the President of the
Republic of Turkey, Mr. Ozal.
The atrocious war that has been waged for over a year in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, with devastating effect upon that Republic, is of deep concern to
Spain. My country has been doing everything possible to relieve the suffering
of the civilian population of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the main victim of this
cruel conflict, and has contributed an infantry battalion to the United
Nations Protection Force for the protection of the humanitarian convoys
organized by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
But it is no longer enough merely to attend to humanitarian needs. It is
necessary for this war to end. To that end, the Spanish Government believes
that the peace plan proposed by the two Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee
of the International Peace Conference on the Former Yugoslavia represents the
only fair and viable alternative for achieving stable and lasting peace in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. Here, I wish to pay a tribute to the presence of
Secretary Vance, who has once again shown us the clarity of his thinking.
That is why the Spanish Government has defended the the Vance-Owen plan. It
will have to be supported firmly, unequivocally and without further delay by
the Security Council.
In a gesture whose bravery we hail, the Government of Bosnia and
Herzegovina has finally lent its support to the peace plan, as has the Bosnian
Croat party. Unfortunately, the Bosnian Serbs have not abandoned their
obstinate rejection of fundamental aspects of the plan, and they continue to
resort to force to achieve their military and political objectives.
S/PV.3200
17
(Mr, Yanez-Barnuevo, Spain)
The European Community and its member States have clearly expressed on
repeated occasions, most recently in its statement of 5 April 1993, that:
"""Non-acceptance of the peace plan would entail the gravest consequences"
and lead to the total isolation of Serbia and Montenegro at the
"international level."""
Convinced that the time has come to take concrete measures to that end,
and as members of the European Community, we have helped to elaborate a series
of measures to deal with the current situation within the framework of the
responsibility incumbent upon the Security Council. Indeed, the draft
resolution which the Council has before it, in addition to endorsing the
Vance-Owen peace plan, strengthens the sanctions regime now in force. It
incorporates essential elements for a package prepared by the European
Community with a view to increasing the effectiveness of the sanctions imposed
on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and at the same time opens up other
prospects if there is a radical change in the attitude of the Bosnian Serbs.
My delegation participated actively in the writing of this draft
resolution, which Spain is co-sponsoring, and wishes to draw attention to its
great political importance. With its adoption, the Security Council will be
sending a clear and forceful message to the Bosnian Serbs and the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia to abandon once and for all the language of force and
accept the hand being extended to them by the international community, or be
faced with the serious consequences of persisting in their current
intransigent attitude.
Indeed, if the Bosnian Serbs accept the peace plan and implement it fully
and in good faith, it will make possible a gradual easing of the pressure
"brought to bear on them and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; it will pave"
the way for a review of the sanctions and their eventual lifting. If, on the
S/PV.3200
18
(Mr, Yanez-Barnuevo, Spain)
contrary, the Bosnian Serbs do not desist from their current policy, they and
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will remain isolated from the rest of the
international community and will suffer the full effects of the Council's
sanctions.
The Council postponed the adoption of this draft resolution in order to
give the Bosnian Serbs another opportunity to end their attacks and, at the
same time, to allow extra time in which to redouble the efforts to convince
the Serbian side of the need to endorse the Vance-Owen plan. Here, we wish to
express our appreciation for the efforts made by the United States and the
Russian Federation to attain that objective. Unfortunately, that did not
occur. On the contrary, the Bosnian Serbs have exploited the time since the
postponement of the vote to continue and even step up their military pressure
on Sarajevo and on eastern Bosnia, particularly on the people of Srebrenica,
the hapless victims of cruel attacks.
The Serbian party has not really made any progress towards the signing of
the Vance-Owen peace plan either, and thus far we have seen nothing,
unfortunately, to allow us to hope for any positive developments in that
direction. The time allowed by the Council as a gesture of goodwill has in
fact been used to create de facto situations in the field which are directly
contrary to the objectives sought by the international community as embodied
in the Vance-Owen plan.
Given this situation, my Government has reached the conclusion that the
draft resolution before us must be put to a vote without further delay. we
trust that, through the adoption of this draft resolution, the Serb leaders
will finally understand that the acceptance of the good will of the
international community, represented by the Council, is the only way to put an
S/PV.3200
19-20
(Mr, Yanez-Barnuevo, Spain)
end to the spiral of suffering and destruction afflicting Bosnia and
Herzegovina and threatening the entire region.
Mr, O'BRIEN (New Zealand): The Council is meeting now, basically,
because all of its earlier calls upon the Bosnian Serbs to choose the way of
peace have not been heeded. New Zealand sincerely regrets that. The manner
in which the Bosnian Serbs have turned their backs upon the peace process of
the Geneva Conference Chairmen is deeply regrettable and it does demand a
response by this Council.
In the weeks since the Bosnian Serb delegation quit the negotiating
process in New York, a pattern of aggression and outrage has continued
unabated. The continued hostility, punctuated as it has been with cease-fires
of doubtful integrity, is deplorable by all standards of humanity. Too many
promises have been broken, too many obligations ignored.
S/PV.3200
21
(Mr, O'Brien, New Zealand)
The Council's determination to respond to the violation of its decisions
and its resolutions has been underestimated by those implicated in this sad
situation on the ground, and the decision here tonight that we should take
should help to correct that misapprehension.
The draft resolution that we are about to vote on represents an
enhancement of the Council's support for the Vance-Owen plan. Like my Spanish
colleague, I would like to pay a tribute to both the Co-Chairmen, especially
Secretary Vance, who is to step down at the end of this month. His
contribution will not be forgotten.
The draft resolution that we are about to vote on must driye home the
message that peaceful negotiation is and must be the way forward, and that
message needs to be driven home again and again. New Zealand will vote for
the draft resolution, and it will adopt the necessary measures to give it
effect.
The PRESIDENT: I shall now put to the vote the draft resolution
contained in document S/25558, as orally revised in its provisional form.
A vote was taken by a show of hands.
In favour:	Brazil, Cape Verde, Djibouti, France, Hungary, Japan,
Morocco, New Zealand, Pakistan, Spain, United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of
America, Venezuela
Against:	None
Abstaining:	China, Russian Federation
The PRESIDENT: The result of the voting is as follows: 13 votes in
favour, none against and 2 abstentions. The draft resolution, as orally
revised in its provisional form, has been adopted as resolution 820 (1993).
S/PV.3200
22
(The President)
I shall now call on those members of the Council who wish to make
statements following the voting.
Mr. OLHAYE (Djibouti): My delegation would like to add its firm
support to the resolution just adopted by the Council seeking to severely
tighten economic sanctions and trade embargoes specifically on Serbia and
Montenegro. By its terms, breadth and tone, it represents a clear expression
of the firm resolve, impatience and unity of the world community to bring this
terrible chapter of recent history to a swift close. This can be brought
about by the simple addition of two signatures to the Vance-Owen peace plan,
which the world now in effect demands from the Serbs.
The resolution perhaps signals a halt to the endless, protracted
good-faith negotiations of the past, so often converted into a mechanism for
attempting unilateral changes in the underlying situational factors. By
setting a firm time period of nine days for the Serbs to respond, it leaves
little doubt as to what that response should be.
The resolution again recognizes the source of the Bosnian Serbs'
intransigence, namely, the leadership of Serbia and Montenegro. Without its
provision of manpower, supplies, logistics and military equipment, we feel
they would have long ago signed and implemented the Vance-Owen plan.
Consequently, the teeth of the resolution are aimed at Serbia and Montenegro.
The consequences for Yugoslavia under the resolution just adopted by the
Council are so far the most severe and may effectively seal off that country
from the world's economy, finance, commerce and the easy movement of people.
In banning the transshipment of supplies through Yugoslavia and the movement
of goods along the Danube and by impounding all Yugoslav aircraft, rolling
stock and trucks, the resolution will certainly bring economic activity to a
near-halt. Placing a freeze on Yugoslav international financial assets will
S/PV.3200
23
(Mr, Olhaye, Djibouti)
make the leaders of that country realize, if nothing else, that the world is
now indeed very serious. They can have few illusions about the Council's
determination to bring peace to Bosnia. We hope that they do not continue to
believe that events in other parts of the world will somehow conspire to
protect them from the inevitable course of justice, and that such events do
not lead them into serious miscalculations or to underestimate the Council's
resolve.
Should the Serbs refuse to sign the plan, they could then pursue their
"objectives only by a return to their inhuman policy of ""ethnic cleansing"" and"
"by increasing their crimes against humanity: the detention camps; the heavy"
"bombardment of population centres, as we are now witnessing in Srebrenica; and"
the denial of humanitarian aid to the suffering. It is inconceivable that
they could harbour any illusions regarding the world’s almost-certain violent
reaction to a return to such a heinous state of affairs.
At the very least, in addition to the restrictions in the present
resolution - which most certainly will wreak further havoc on the Yugoslav
economy - as well as the recently approved no-fly-zone enforcement, there
would have to be a redressing of the arms imbalance between the adversaries
and measures to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid by all necessary
means. It would represent a serious misreading of the Council's intentions by
the Serbs and could only further damage and retard their eventual acceptance
into the world community. Naked aggression simply cannot be seen to succeed.
The broad future political dimensions of Bosnia have in fact been already
determined, as attested to by the signature of the Serbs themselves to the
nine constitutional principles. This will be a single, independent State, and
at this point, efforts designed to unilaterally alter this fact or the
country's boundaries by force of arms and acts against humanity will not be
S/PV.3200
24-25
(Mr, Olhave, Djibouti^
allowed. It is this aspect of the situation that makes the killing and
suffering so tragic.
The time is opportune, for the Serbs must know that events in other parts
of the world are unlikely to conspire, as I have already said, to protect them
from the inevitable course of justice. The high-profile defiance of the Serbs
has caught the world’s attention, particularly in the light of the
reprehensible methods they have used to achieve their purposes. It has raised
profound and significant moral issues that will have long and serious
implications for the world as we enter a very nationalistic, post-cold-war
era, and no amount of effort to impart a less moral spin to this issue can
hide this fact. Historical enmity, however deep, cannot be accepted by the
world as a justification for behaviour that contradicts international
humanitarian standards. If we are to promote such a justification in Bosnia,
then it has to be in a way that permits each side to defend its very
survival. Not to do so may have more lasting repercussions for us than our
unwillingness to forcefully come to the aid of victims of aggression.
For this and other reasons, my delegation, while supporting this
resolution, has few illusions it will go far enough by itself to correct the
fast-deteriorating situation in a timely and meaningful manner. Raising the
cost of aggression by sealing Yugoslavia and the Bosnian Serbs off and
allowing the Bosnian Government the means to defend itself clearly offers the
best hope for a way out of this moral dilemma.

Sir David HANNAY (United Kingdom): The origin of this resolution
lies in the Vance-Owen peace process, and I should like to begin my statement
by paying tribute to the work done by the two Co-Chairmen over the last few
months, and particularly to pay a special tribute to Secretary Vance, who is
now laying down his task, but not before he has brought an enormous
contribution to one of the most difficult tasks that has ever faced a diplomat
in modern history.
The 25th of March was a crucial date in the Vance-Owen peace process. It
was the date on which the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina signed a
complex series of agreements, as did the Bosnian Croat leaders. There was
then, at last, in this horrendous and bloodstained saga, a chance for peace.
My Government was determined that that chance should be seized, and from the
morrow of the 25th of March we worked with others - most closely with our
fellow States members of the European Community on the Council, the United
States and the non-aligned caucus - on this resolution, which has a triple
purpose. The first purpose is to throw the weight of the Council firmly
behind the peace process of the two Co-Chairmen and to get across to the
Bosnian Serbs that signature of these documents represents the only way to
assure their future as a distinct community within the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. The second purpose is to bring home to the Bosnian Serbs and
their backers in Belgrade the consequences of rejection, in the form of
tightened sanctions and complete isolation. And the third is to show that
acceptance and implementation of the peace process and the plan, and the
cessation of all military attacks, will bring real benefits to all Serbs - to
those in Bosnia as to those in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia - in the
form of a gradual lifting of sanctions and a reintegration into the
international and European families.
S/PV.32OO
27
(Sir David Hannav, United Kin^)
Those are the messages that this resolution is designed to send. We hope
they will be received, and that in the nine days to come decisive steps will
be taken, both in the peace process and on the ground.
The last three weeks have been a tragic and deeply disturbing time. The
Bosnian Serbs have continued their policy of talk and grab. The talk has been
vague and evasive, an attempt to do anything but accept the Vance-Owen peace
process. The grab has been all too clear in the squeezing of the pocket
around Srebrenica, culminating this week in the criminal bombardment of
civilians, resulting in the death of many women and children. This process
simply has to stop. It cannot be justified by any amount of casuistical
presentation.
I should like, however, to end on a note of hope. There is in this
resolution the basis for a better future for all the peoples of the former
Yugoslavia. But that requires a definitive end to the military attacks by the
Bosnian Serbs, and it requires clear and unambiguous acceptance of the
Vance-Owen peace plan. If the Bosnian Serbs and the authorities in Belgrade
turn their backs on this opportunity, they will have no one to blame but
themselves.
Ms, ALBRIGHT (United States of America): The United States joins
the other members of the Council in condemning in the strongest possible terms
the actions of the Bosnian Serbs during this past week and, more generally,
throughout their unprovoked aggression.
This omnibus sanctions package was a means of again bringing home to the
leaders of the Bosnian Serbs and their allies, Serbia and Montenegro, the
price they and their people will have to pay for their brutal policies and
"""ethnic cleansing"". We will continue to work with all Governments in	,"
reinforcing economic sanctions to reaffirm our outrage at these atrocities.
S/PV.3200
28
(Ms. Albright, United States)
This resolution, which will come into effect on 26 April, as originally-
planned, gives the Bosnian Serbs time to sign the agreement. This conflict
has been filled with tragedy from the start, but we are particularly appalled
at the death and destruction the Bosnian Serb forces have visited upon the
people in the enclave of Srebrenica in recent weeks.
We have repeatedly warned the Bosnian Serbs - most recently by Council
action yesterday - that these violations of basic human rights are
intolerable. We shall continue to seek ways to underscore to the Bosnian
Serbs the long-term conseguences of their actions.
Mr. ARRIA (Venezuela) (interpretation from Spanish): , My delegation
associates itself with the statement by the President of the Council on the
occasion of the death of President Turgut Ozal of Turkey. We wish to express
our condolences to his family and the people of that friendly country.
"The world has been watching with horror as the policy of ""ethnic"
"cleansing"" promoted by Serbian leaders has been outdone by a policy of ethnic"
"extermination, or what the Nazis called ""Endlosung"": final solution. The"
international community, however, seemed not to have fully grasped the future
conseguences of the barbaric acts committed in the middle of the Europe of
Maastricht, conseguences which are not limited to the military sphere, but
also extend into moral and ethical dimensions. The'truth of the matter is
that a very dangerous precedent has been set, one that, because of the slight
toll taken by international sanctions, could be imitated in Europe and other
regions.
The world is not forgetful of the fact that a year and a half ago, when
Serbian leaders began the destruction of the historic city of Dubrovnik, it
was the time to take a firm stand. But the timid reaction of the
"international community was taken advantage of; from Dubrovnik they carried on"
S/PV.3200
29
(Mr, Arria, Venezuela)
to Vukovar, and to date they have not stopped, continuing with the devastation
and effective subjugation of Srebrenica.
Experience convinces the Serbian leaders that no matter what they do,
nobody will lay a finger on them. The confusion of legend with history imbues
them with an invincibility that is unreal but that, incredibly, is enough to
hold at bay the most powerful armies in the world. Destroying cities,
massacring civilians, terrorizing children, women and old men - these are not
exactly feats of military prowess. It is not bravery, but the extraordinary
advantage of having planes, artillery and tanks to use against defenceless
populations that do not have such resources that has allowed them to draw a
map of blood and fire, a different map from that of distinguished Co-Chairmen
"Cyrus Vance and David Owen. A new world order cannot be founded on ""ethnic"
"cleansing"" and genocide, and it is unacceptable that such effronteries might"
somehow be allowed.
Throughout the conflict the support of the former Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) has been clearly evident, as it has
inflicted grave human and material damage on the people and patrimony of the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. My country considers that today only the
acceptance of the proposed Peace Agreements offers the international community
a chance to improve the situation, as the Secretary-General stated in his
report (S/25479).
The resolution we have just adopted is still aimed at applying pressure
for peace. However, as long as the Security Council does not act to put under
real and effective international control the heavy arms that are solely in the
hands of the Serbs, little will be achieved through economic sanctions, whose
"effects take time; and time is of the essence for the besieged victims of"
Srebrenica and Sarajevo. By the same token, we believe it is essential to
S/PV.3200
30
(Mr. Arria, Venezuela)
discourage the illusion that war and genocide, carried out with impunity, are
"legitimate means of manifesting the right to self-determination; and to"
curtail any claim that ethnic, cultural or religious ties give States the
right to interfere in the internal crises of any other State.
My country's concern for the strengthening of our Organization and the
defence of the principles upon which it is founded takes precedence over any
other consideration and is the only motive underlying the pronouncements we
have been making in the Security Council since the beginning of this conflict.
S/PV.3200
31
(Mr. Arria, Venezuela)
The judgment of the International Court of Justice on 8 April suggests,
implicitly, that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) is
possibly responsible for committing crimes of genocide. This is a serious
responsibility. If there is negligence - or, worse, omission - the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia would be responsible for genocide. Genocide is the
worst crime against humanity, and everyone must understand it as such.
If the international community, represented by the Security Council, is
not capable of meeting the concern expressed unambiguously by the
International Court of Justice, the credibility and the legitimacy of the
whole international political and judicial system would be profoundly and
seriously compromised. A new world order cannot be based on a Security
Council that is not capable of stopping genocide.
Mr, CHEN Jian (China) (interpretation from Chinese): The Chinese
delegation has followed with great concern the development of the crisis in
the former Yugoslavia, and especially the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We have, all along, supported the tireless efforts of the Co-Chairmen for the
political settlement of the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina within the
framework of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia.
Therefore, we urge the parties concerned to reach agreement promptly on the
Co-Chairmen's peace plan through consultations and negotiations so as to pave
the way for the achievement of national reconciliation and reconstruction in
Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The resolution just adopted commends the unremitting efforts of the
Co-Chairmen in the peace negotiations, reiterates the necessity of achieving a
lasting peace acceptable to all the parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and
emphasizes the importance of ensuring the sovereignty and territorial
S/PV.3200
32
(Mr, Chen Jian, China)
integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. These elements are
basically in conformity with our principled position. We therefore welcome
and support these elements in the resolution.
At the same time, we wish to point out that, proceeding from our
consistent position, we find it difficult to support such elements in the
resolution as the invocation of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter,
adoption of enforcement measures and the authorization of measures to
strengthen and expand the existing sanctions regime against the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia. History has shown that it is impossible to find
lasting solutions to conflicts and disputes by exerting pressure externally
and adopting such enforcement measures as sanctions.
In addition, the actions authorized by the resolution will not only bring
suffering to the people in the country targeted by the sanctions regime but
also be gravely detrimental to the economies of the third countries
implementing such sanctions provisions. From the long-term point of view,
such a practice will create adverse political and economic consequences for
the regions concerned. This is not something the international community
would wish to see.
In our view, the international community should continue to explore all
possibilities so as actively to promote peace negotiations and should avoid
taking any action that might further complicate the issue.
We have noted that there are also some elements in this resolution that
run counter to the principle of respect for sovereignty contained in the
United Nations Charter.
Since this resolution contains both elements we can support and elements
we cannot, the Chinese delegation therefore abstained in the vote on the
resolution just adopted.
S/PV.3200
33
Mr. HATANO (Japan): It was with a heavy heart that I voted in
favour of the resolution. My Government does not treat economic sanctions
"lightly; many innocent parties in and outside the former Yugoslavia will"
suffer as a result of this resolution, but this is a necessary price we have
to pay for peace and justice in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In the view of my Government, durable peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina
cannot be achieved unless it is based on an agreement reached through
negotiations between the parties concerned. The best hope - or the only
hope - lies in the peace plan being promoted by the Co-Chairmen of the
International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, and I wish to express my
highest respect and admiration to the Co-Chairman, especially to Mr. Vance,
who is to leave this responsibility in the near future.
I deeply regret that the Bosnian Serb party has not agreed to interim
arrangements and the provincial map which constitutes a central part of the
peace plan. The Bosnian Serb party must stop all hostilities, especially
military attacks against Sarajevo and Srebrenica, and also sign the two
documents of the peace plan.
My Government calls upon the Bosnian Serbs to do so without delay, before
many more people have to die in vain.
Mr, ERDOS (Hungary) (interpretation from French): Hungary found
itself in a rather difficult position when the draft resolution the Security
Council has just adopted today as resolution 820 (1993) was put to the vote.
Let there be no misunderstanding: for my country, there was no question of an
attitude of reluctance or of appeasement in the face of the aggression that
has been sweeping the former Yugoslavia for almost two years now, nor is there
any question of wanting to stand idly by while we watch the constant and
S/PV.3200
34-35
(Mr, Erdos, Hungary)
cynical violations of the Security Council's resolutions, or in any way of
preventing the international community from being able, in accordance with the
principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter, to give a firm and
unambiguous response to the challenges that have been hurled against it. We
believe that the attitude Hungary has shown and the positions it has taken on
the matter since the crisis in the former Yugoslavia erupted speak for
themselves.
It is regrettable that in the blood-stained period just past we were
obliged to observe, time after time, that the world Organization, regional
institutions and individual countries were not capable of judging properly and
in time the scale, the possible outcomes, the consequences and the broader
repercussions of the processes that had been embarked upon in the former
Yugoslavia. The history of this conflict proves that the international
community has missed several unique and precious opportunities to mobilize
right from the outset, even before the carnage degenerated into a diabolical
escalation, and make it understood, by the positions it took and beyond
possibility of doubt, that the world is not prepared to tolerate having the
United Nations Charter, the binding resolutions of the Security Council and
the agreements and documents of high-level international conferences
constantly and systematically ignored and flouted.
S/PV.3200
36
(Mr, Erdos, Hungary)
Long before the siege of Sarajevo started, Hungary had drawn the Security
Council's attention to the explosive nature of the situation in Bosnia and
Herzegovina - a situation it had then described as a source of potential
danger not only to the region but also to international peace and security.
That is why Hungary had advocated at the appropriate time the introduction of
adequate preventive measures with a view to containing the conflict in the
former Yugoslavia, in particular through the deployment of United Nations
observers in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In so doing, Hungary was
acting as one of the countries most affected - because of its geographical
proximity - by the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.
In the absence of an appropriate international response to the crisis,
Hungary was not really surprised to see the repetition, mutatis mutandis, in
the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina of open aggression aiming it the
conquest of territory. Much has been said recently in the press, and even
within these walls, about these events. We would simply note that, over and
above the untiring, praiseworthy international efforts which have been exerted
in various bodies and which we duly appreciate, the way in which our world, at
the end of the twentieth century, has reacted to the crisis in the former
Yugoslavia, the steps that it has taken in this context, will not, in our
opinion, become brilliant pages of contemporary history. Rather, they will
leave a heavy heritage of lessons for future generations. These pages of
history will be pages of grief, destruction, complacency and impotence. And
it seems to us that it is still much too early to reply to the question
whether we are entitled to hope that the international community will manage
to draw the conclusions required by this lesson of history.
For us, the resolution that the Security Council has just adopted today
has been and remains a dilemma for another reason as well. For, as experience
S/PV.3200
37
(Mr, Erdos, Hungary)
has shown in several other crises, sanctions are not necessarily and
exclusively the salutary solution which can meet the challenge. From all the
successive events in the crisis in the former Yugolsavia, it-Jtias become
increasingly clear that the general arms embargo decreed in the autumn of
1991, as well as the economic-sanctions regime instituted in the spring of
1992 and then extended last autumn, are not producing the results that the
international community had legitimately expected. The reasons for this are,
inter alia, the specific conditions in the former Yugoslavia, the particular
features resulting from the geographic situation of the country, the
establishment of domestic mitigating arrangements, and the nature of any
sanctions regime, which, a priori, is porous.
Because of what I have just said, the Hungarian party has had occasion
several times in the past to mention the problems and reservations it has had
with regard to the strengthening of sanctions. In this opinion it has also
quite naturally been motivated by the fact that Hungary is a State bordering
on the former Yugoslavia and that our country and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) are linked by the Danube, which is one of
the most important communication routes in Europe, and, last but not least, by
the fact that there is in Vojvodina - a territory that is part of Serbia - an
ethnic Hungarian community of almost half a million persons who are still
suffering the tragic consequences of the conflict launched by greater-Serbian
nationalism.
We can hardly underestimate the economic losses the crisis has already
caused the States neighbouring the former Yugoslavia, including Hungary.
Because of the sanctions regime instituted against the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), the Hungarian economy has suffered losses
S/PV.3200
38
(Mr, Erdos, Hungary)
amounting to almost half a billion United States dollars. The implementation
of the resolution adopted today by the Security Council, the strengthening of
the sanctions, are going to engender further economic difficulties for our
country, as well as for the other neighbouring countries. The stricter
conditions that have just been established for transit on the Danube will
cause Hungarian industries even more serious problems than those they are
facing at present. The interdiction from now on of practically all transit
through the land borders of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro) will, in turn, have similar effects on other sectors of our
economy. Because of the tightening of the sanction measures, we expect that
the transport by land of products and commodities between the Middle East and
Western Europe, which is known to be very intense, will move to the border
between Hungary and Romania - a border whose limited capacity of absorption is
not our fault - where lamentable conditions already exist and where we can
foresee new complex situations, whose scope it is still difficult to predict.
These problems raise once again, and with the force of timeliness, the
question of the international consequences of the sanctions regimes which have
recently been proliferating, as well as the question of the equitable and
appropriate treatment of these consequences. It is because of the absence of
such solutions that we must at present face the challenge of the new situation
resulting from the strengthening of sanctions against the former Yugoslavia.
It is tragic to note that the nationalist forces aspiring to ethnic
exclusivity and homogeneity are endangering and destroying material goods not
only of the peoples living in Bosnia and Herzegovina, that they are inflicting
suffering and privation not only on civilians in Serbia and Montenegro, but
that, at the same time, they are causing incalculable damage and, through the
S/PV.3200
39-40
(Mr, Erdos, Hungary)
presence of hundreds of thousands of refugees forced to move to the territory
of the neighbouring States, are imposing an additional burden on third
countries that are not parties to the conflict. All this lends even greater
and more depressing dimensions to the revolting violations of the most
elementary norms of international law, international humanitarian law and
human rights being committed in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Despite all that, Hungary, as in the past, will continue to carry out all
the obligations stemming from the relevant Council resolutions. Our
delegation's affirmative vote on resolution 820 (1993) has been motivated
above all by the fundamental importance we attach to sending a sufficiently
firm message to the representatives of greater-Serbian nationalism, in Serbia
and outside it, who bear a basic responsibility for the conflict in the former
Yugoslavia. Such action has become even more necessary as a result of the
decisions taken by the so-called Bosnian Serbian parliament to reject the
peace plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina, and as a result of the most recent
tragic developments on the ground. We must do everything to ensure that in
the territories controlled by the Serbs the heavy weapons fall silent, the
snipers have no more ammunition with which to kill, and the military transport
vehicles are unable to move because they have no gasoline. In a word, we must
do everything to ensure that an end is put to the activity between the
territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and
the zones controlled by the Serbs in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
activity carried out in violation of the relevant Council resolutions, and
that, thereby, the military machine of the Serbs in Bosnia is immobilized.
S/PV.3200
41
(Mr. Erdos, Hungary)
Hungary's vote in favour of today's resolution is further explained by
the fact that the sanctions measures, despite their comprehensive nature, will
not lead in the final analysis to building a new Berlin wall between the
civilian populations living on the two sides of the border between the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and its neighbours.
Telecommunications, postal services and humanitarian services will not become
more difficult. It will be unnecessary to reduce the number of border
crossings serving passenger traffic, and funds belonging to individuals will
not be affected by the new measures either.
Another element to be welcomed in the resolution is that, by virtue of an
earlier Council resolution, the United Nations Protection Force will finally
have to exercise effectively the tasks assigned to it of controlling
immigration and customs along the international borders of the United Nations
Protected Areas in Croatia, which are supposed be controlled by United Nations
forces but are currently under Serb dominion. In one of those Protected
Areas, for example, along the Hungarian border, there has been an arbitrary
closing on the Serbian side of a vitally important border post intended to
guarantee movement to the civilian populations of the region. On the basis of
this Security Council resolution, we also expect that effective monitoring of
navigation will be established throughout the Yugoslav section of the Danube,
which can promote the assistance of the international community to such
activities of the riparian States.
In conclusion, Hungary believes Security Council resolution 820 (1993) to
be an important step towards a settlement of the crisis in the former
Yugoslavia. We voted in its favour, convinced that with the strengthening of
the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro), the losses suffered by the legitimate trade of neighbouring
S/PV.3200
42
(Mr. Erdos, Hungary)
countries, including my own, can and must be minimized. We also voted in
favour because of the resolution's stipulations reaffirming the sovereignty,
territorial integrity and political independence of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, the illegality and positively unacceptable nature of any
"acquisition of territory by force and of any practice of ""ethnic cleansing"","
as well as the international community's readiness to take all necessary
measures to help implement the peace.plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
This also means that the Security Council, over and above the
implementation of sanctions, will have to continue to remain vigilant and
continue indefinitely to follow developments in the situation. , It will also
have to take appropriate decisions on the use of whatever other means may be
deemed the most effective in bringing the conflict to a close, establishing
peace, and achieving a fair and lasting settlement.
Allow me to close my statement by citing the words of a twentieth-century
Hungarian writer, Sandor Marai, who, in considering our era, asked this
crucial question:
"""Will the force of reason and solidarity prove more powerful than"
"the terror of instincts?"""
We wholeheartedly hope that the international community will be able
promptly, through acts of commitment, to give an appropriate response to this
disturbing question.
Mr, SNOUSSI (Morocco) (interpretation from French): Today, the
Council has adopted a new resolution in which it imposes a certain number of
sanctions to convince and, if need be, to compel the Serbs finally to agree to
the plan drawn up by Mr. Vance and Mr. Owen after very strenuous negotiations
and efforts that deserve tha admiration of us all.
S/PV.3200
43
(Mr, Snoussi, Morocco)
Bosnia, martyred and torn assunder, for its part did not hesitate to sign
that agreement, which neither solves its problems nor provides justice for the
suffering it has endured.
Time and again, within these walls, we have condemned the violence,
crimes and horrors perpetrated by the Serbs on their Bosnian brothers. We
have repeatedly appealed for and urged an end to the fighting, to the horrible
"""ethnic cleansing"", the expulsion of the Muslims and all the crimes"
committed. In reply to our appeals and resolutions, the Serbs and the
Government supporting them have stepped up their activities and, most
recently, to crown their shamelessness and defiance, attacked the city of
Srebrenica, adding its dead to those fallen in Sarajevo and its displaced
population to those wandering throughout eastern Europe.
International opinion and the International Court of Justice have finally
recognized that this is a case of genocide, which our Council has been saying
for almost two years now. Today, the international community felt it
necessary to enter a new stage and perhaps finally to impose sanctions which
no country anywhere could ignore. It is to be feared, however, that we may
soon need to go even further, given the contempt in which the Serbs hold our
rules and values.
The new reflections to which our Council has for some time lent itself
allow us nevertheless to say that sooner or later we will overcome the
arrogance and cynicism with which all our recommendations and resolutions have
been met so far. We ask no more than that the Serbs at last awake and display
wisdom and a realistic attitude. We hope they will realize that, whatever the
blind and criminal pressures by whiGh they have profited, they cannot go on
indefinitely challenging the international community.
S/PV.3200
44
(Mr, Snoussi, Morocco)
In saying this, I express the hope that the international community will
remain vigilant and no longer tolerate the intolerable. Thus will Serbia at
last understand that it must abandon its dreams of grandeur and dominion.
The PRESIDENT: I shall now make a statement in my capacity as
representative of Pakistan.
My delegation has voted in favour of resolution 820 (1993), just adopted
by the Council. We believe that this is an appropriate occasion to pay a
tribute to the exceptional efforts of Secretary Vance and Lord Owen, the
Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the
Former Yugoslavia. As he leaves office, Secretary Vance takes with him the
gratitude and good wishes of all people who value and honour peace and those
who live it and work for it.
Although my delegation feels that today's action by the Council
represents an insufficient response by the international community to the
unfolding tragedy of devastating proportions in the eastern parts of the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it is our hope that the passage of this
resolution will send a firm message to the Bosnian Serbs to cease their
deliberate armed attacks and the shelling of the innocent civilian population
and to withdraw their forces from the occupied areas.
We condemn the violations of international humanitarian law, in
"particular the practice of ""ethnic cleansing"" by the Bosnian Serb party, and"
reaffirm that those who commit or order the commission of such acts of
genocide shall be held individually responsible for such acts.
My delegation has consistently declared that the time has come for the
international community to demonstrate its firm resolve in compelling the
Bosnian Serb party to accept in full the Vance-Owen peace package. In this
S/PV.3200
45
(The President)
context, we believe that this Council should take immediate measures for the
immobilization of heavy weapons in Bosnia and Herzegovina and place them under
"effective international control; that the Council should adopt appropriate"
measures to ensure the interdiction of arms supplies to the Bosnian Serb
"party; and that further measures, including stringent financial sanctions, be"
imposed against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).
My delegation is also of the view that immediate measures should be taken
for the partial lifting of the arms embargo in order to enable the Muslims of
Bosnia and Herzegovina to exercise their inherent right of self-defence, the
denial of which has already cost them so many valuable and innocent lives.
I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.
There are no further speakers inscribed on my list. The Security Council
