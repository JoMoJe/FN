ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
THE SITUATION IN THE REPUBLIC OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Russian): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of
Bosnia and Herzegovina in which he requests to be invited to participate in
the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the
usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the discussion, without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr, Sacirbey (Bosnia and Herzegovina)
took a place at the Council table.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Russian): The Security Council
will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.
Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have
been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council. It
includes a number of revisions, agreed upon by Council members, to the draft
text now before members.

(The President)
"""The Security Council, recalling its statement of 21 April 1993"
(S/25646) concerning the atrocities and killings in areas north and west
of Sarajevo, expresses its grave concern at the major new military
offensive launched by Bosnian Croat paramilitary units in the areas of
Mostar, Jablanica and Dreznica.
"""The Security Council strongly condemns this major military"
offensive launched by Bosnian Croat paramilitary units which is totally
inconsistent with the signature of the Peace Plan by the Bosnian Croat
party, for the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Council demands
that the attacks against the areas of Mostar, Jablanica and Dreznica
"cease forthwith; that Bosnian Croat paramilitary units withdraw"
immediately from the area and that all the parties strictly comply with
their previous commitments as well as the cease-fire agreed to today
between the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the
Bosnian Croat party.
"""The Security Council also expresses its deep concern that the"
UNPROFOR battalion in the area has been forced under fire to redeploy as
a result of this latest offensive and condemns the refusal of the Bosnian
Croat paramilitary units to allow the presence of United Nations military
observers, in particular in the city of Mostar.
"""The Security Council once again reiterates its demand that UNPROFOR"
personnel be allowed unimpeded access throughout the Republic of Bosnia
and Herzegovina and, in this particular case, demands that the Bosnian
Croat paramilitary units ensure the safety and security of UNPROFOR as
S/PV.3210

(The President)
well as all United Nations personnel in the areas of Mostar, Jablanica
and Dreznica. In this connection, the Council expresses its deep concern
at the increasing hostile attitude of Bosnian Croat paramilitary units
towards UNPROFOR personnel.
"""The Security Council calls upon the Republic of Croatia, in"
"accordance with the commitments under the Zagreb agreement; of"
25 April 1993 (S/25659), to exert all its influence on the Bosnian Croat
leadership and paramilitary units with a view to ceasing immediately
their attacks particularly in the areas of Mostar, Jablanica and
Dreznica. It further calls on the Republic of Croatia to adhere strictly
to its obligations under Security Council resolution 752 (1992),
including putting an end to all forms of interference and respecting the
territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
"""The Security Council once again reaffirms the sovereignty,"
territorial integrity and independence of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, and the unacceptability of the acquisition of territory by
force and the practice of 'ethnic cleansing'.
"""The Security Council remains seized of the matter and is ready to"
consider further measures to ensure that all parties and others concerned
"abide by their commitments and fully respect relevant Council decisions""."
This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under
the symbol S/25746.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on the agenda. The Security Council will remain
seized of the matter.
The meeting rose at 7,15 p.m.
