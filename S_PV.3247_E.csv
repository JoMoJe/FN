I now call.
S/PV.3247

Mr. JESUS (Cape Verde): The people and the Government of my country
have followed the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina with a deep feeling of
frustration.
Through this ordeal, we have witnessed all kinds of crimes being
committed against the people of Bosnia in persistent, deliberate and defiant
disregard for international humanitarian law. Mass rape and forced pregnancy,
ethnic cleansing, indiscriminate killing, torture, deliberate shelling of
civilian targets and starvation have been pursued constantly and primarily as
a Serb policy designed to conguer and occupy territory in Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
There has been universal condemnation of such crimes. Time and again,
Governments, humanitarian institutions, non-governmental organizations and the
citizens of this world have expressed their anguish over this tragic and
unacceptable situation and have cried out for measures to stop the carnage,
reverse the aggression and defend the victims of this armed conflict.
The Security Council itself has met countless times to consider this
situation and has adopted more than 40 resolutions to deal with the conflict.
Notwithstanding the measures decided by the Council - some of them adopted
even under Chapter VII - the United Nations has been unable, to our regret, to
take action to contain the war, effectively defend the civilian population and
stop the abhorrent practice of ethnic cleansing.
The lack of political will on the part of those that have the power and
the means and bear the special responsibility to carry out, and ensure the
implementation of, the decisions of this Council is a cause of major concern
to my country. Indeed, it sends a very disturbing message to those of us that
believe that our security and the security of the world at large can, in the
end, be maintained only through a reliable United Nations collective security
system.
S/PV.3247
7
(Mr. Jesus, Cape Verde)
The failure of the Council and the Organization to implement effectively
the Charter collective security provisions with a view to honouring the
Council’s decisions on the Bosnian conflict is bound to have a major negative
impact on the outcome of the current and potential conflicts. It might be
interpreted by those that would like to take in their hands the solution of
their disputes with others as incapacity by the United Nations to stand up to
its responsibilities to maintain peace and reverse aggression. The situation
might escalate, and at best the progress in arms negotiations might be
delayed, for one of the most negative lessons that might be drawn from this
conflict is that countries and peoples might have to rely in the future on
their own capacity to defend themselves. It also might give rise to a
credibility problem for this Council that could be detrimental to its handling
of other conflicts.
For the small nations, which are the majority of the Members of this
Organization and which can meet their security needs only by relying on
respect for the principles and norms of international law and on the effective
implementation of the decisions of this Council, especially its Chapter VII
decisions, the Bosnian experience is indeed a very disturbing development.
The caucus of the non-aligned members of the Security Council - namely,
Djibouti, Morocco, Pakistan, Venezuela and my own country, Cape Verde -
believes that the policy goals for dealing with the Bosnian conflict would be
best met through the action of the United Nations and the effective
implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions. Unfortunately,
this has not been possible, to our regret.
Therefore, if the United Nations is unable t) take action to halt the
armed conflict and to defend the Muslim civilian population of Bosnia from the
continuous attacks they have been subjected to - as abundantly documented
S/PV.3247
8
(Mr. Jesus, Cape Verde)
through the press - the minimum that can be done by the Council is to allow
them to defend themselves.
For a long time now, calls for United Nations action to assist in the
defence of the Bosnian civilian population from attacks and to save it from
further atrocities have repeatedly gone unheeded. Meanwhile, the safe areas
declared under Chapter VII continue to be consistently challenged by the Serbs
and their protection jeopardized, while we are still witnessing the occupation
of land by force and the practice of ethnic cleansing.
In submitting the draft resolution before the Council, the caucus of the
non-aligned members of the Security Council is responding to a moral call
aimed at enabling those that have been throughout this tragic conflict victims
of aggression and ethnic cleansing to exercise their inherent right of self-
defence as recognized in the Charter of the United Nations. If we, the United
Nations, cannot or do not have the political will to take prompt and effective
action to stop the killing of civilians being perpetrated daily against the
Bosnian Muslims, we should at least allow them to legitimately defend
themselves against such attacks.
Indeed, this caucus draft resolution, in proposing the lifting of the
arms embargo in favour of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, makes it
clear that such a measure is being proposed for the sole purpose of enabling
that Republic to defend itself from attacks and not as a means to escalate the
violence of the conflict.
It is morally wrong and politically disastrous for us to tell the
Bosnians that we cannot defend them from aggression and the repeated attacks
against them and at the same time deny them the means and the right to defend
themselves.
It has been said that the lifting of the arms embargo in favour of Bosnia
S/PV.3247
9-10
(Mr. Jesus, Cape Verde)
is a policy of despair. This might probably be the case. But what kind of
other measures are there to take to defend the lives of the civilian
population and the existence of an entire community that for months has been
constantly under fierce attack and subjected to atrocities, if the United
Nations will not come to their rescue?
Unfortunately, after many failed attempts to have the United Nations play
the role that is its own in the field of the maintenance of peace and
security, we were left, it seemed, with only two options: either to let the
Muslim community continue to die and disappear as a community, at the hands of
their well-equipped enemies, for whom the arms embargo has been throughout the
"conflict a dead letter; or to allow them to exercise the basic and inherent"
right to defend themselves, until a negotiated solution is found.
The caucus, by proposing this draft resolution, has clearly chosen the
latter option, for we believe that acting otherwise would be a great and
painful mistake. Although the lifting of the arms embargo, even when it is
confined to purposes of defence, might be seen by some as a policy of despair,
it is perhaps the only realistic measure that, in the circumstances, might
help to dispel the despair.
The PRESIDENT (intepretation from Spanish): The next speaker is the
representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina, on whom I now call.
Mr. SACIRBEY (Bosnia and Herzegovina): A day before the end of your
term, Mr. President, let me once again congratulate you on the way you have
managed the affairs of the Security Council.
And let me here thank the membership of the non-aligned caucus, and in
particular the Chairman for this month, Ambassador Jesus, on the work that has
been done to bring the cause of Bosnia before the Security Council - something
that is so urgently needed.
S/PV.3247
11
(Mr. Sacirbev, Bosnia and
Herzegovina)
Two questions, and two questions only, are relevant in evaluating the
merit of this draft resolution. First, has the Security Council compelled the
necessary means to stop the aggression and genocide directed at the Republic
and citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina? Secondly, if not, what are the new
and necessary measures that should be undertaken to stop this never-ending
aggression and mayhem, particularly should the arms embargo on the Republic of
Bosnia and Herzegovina be declared de jure invalid in accordance with the
United Nations Charter's guarantee of the right of self-defence? I would also
note that one of the few resolutions effectively implemented with respect to
the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been Security Council resolution
713 (1991).
Some may attempt to confuse the matter by redefining the issues in order
to excuse failure, justify inaction and mask a lack of real commitment to
dealing decisively with the problem. Integrity necessitates that we appraise
the Council's measures primarily on the basis of results and not grandiose
statements made within this Chamber. Fifteen months after the Serbian
"aggression was initiated; 11 months after we all first saw television pictures"
"of Bosnian victims in Serb concentration camps; 10 months after the heralded"
"London Conference and its many promises; eight months after Lord Owen and"
Mr. Vance issued their first set of constitutional principles for Bosnia and
"Herzegovina; three months after we signed the Vance-Owen plan; and after the"
visits of countless well-meaning or self-serving high-profile individuals,
mediators and delegations to Bosnia and Herzegovina, the agony continues and
there is no light at the end of the tunnel.
S/PV.3247
12
(Mr. Sacirbey, Bosnia and
Herzegovina)
Only more conferences and meetings are proposed. New mediators are
appointed while others are retired. Ever more diluted sets of principles,
supposedly insuring Bosnia's sovereignty, territorial integrity and justice
are once again restated. More negotiations, without the means or the will to
implement them, are endlessly pursued. More delegations come to Bosnia. More
"Bosnians are ""ethnically cleansed"" from Bosnia. More Bosnians die in Bosnia."
Indefinite negotiations, conferences and so-called initiatives do not
necessarily advance the cause of peace. But it is clear that some would use
the perception of motion to create the illusion of progress. We, the
Bosnians, are dead tired of running on this treadmill of cynicism that
exhausts us with bitterness, hopelessness and helplessness while serving the
public relations interests of certain political leaders. Clearly, the
necessary measures have not been taken to bring peace, and the Bosnians
subsequently find themselves no further along the road to peace but utterly
drained by the journey. So we come to the second question: What are the new
and necessary measures that should be undertaken to bring peace?
Bosnia consists of hundreds of cities and towns and of thousands of
"villages. While we pursue faithfully the policies established under the ""safe"
"havens"" resolution, who will defend most of our citizens who happen to live in"
these non-safe areas when its seems that even the designated safe areas are
not so safe? Among the Members States here today are some who strongly
advocated the establishment of safe areas in six Bosnian cities as delineated
in resolution 824 (1993), and later committed themselves in resolution
836 (1993)
S/PV.3247
13
(Mr. Sacirbev, Bosnia and
Herzegovina)
"""to ensure full respect for the safe areas referred to in resolution"
"824 (1993)"" (resolution 836 (1993), para. 4)"
and reaffirmed in that resolution:
"""the unacceptability of the acquisition of territory by the use of force"
and the need to restore the full sovereignty, territorial integrity and
"political independence of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina"""
(resolution 836 (1993), para. 3).
Let me inquire of those who were so zealous for the adoption of these
measures the reasons for their deafening silence today. Why was it not enough
for you to respond when shells rained upon the safe-area of Gorazde? Was it
not a clearly observed violation of Sarajevo's safe area status when the
Serbians lobbed several shells into a playground, killing and maiming tens of
children? When will you be prepared to respond if the Secretary-General’s
implementation report on resolution 836 (1993) apparently relies upon the good
conduct of those who still ignore the basic norms of civilized behaviour? How
can you have an effective deterrent force if up to now you have lacked the
will and commitment to confront aggression?
But the most critical question is: For how long do you expect those of
us living in disease-plagued Srebrenica and the other five so-called safe
areas to suffer the indignity, decay and uncertainty of these new holding
pens? How long will you have a commitment to stay? Finally, for how long can
those of us living in the non-safe areas survive in our homes unless you allow
us the means of self-defence? Even assuming effective implementation and
"enforcement, the ""safe areas"" resolution at best can only benefit some of our"
people temporarily and none of our people permanently.
S/PV.3247
14
(Mr. Sacirbey, Bosnia and
Herzegovina)
The latest supposed option to promote peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina
comes directly from the unfortunate President Franjo Tudjman and from Slobodan
Milosevic, the man who initiated aggression and who has been identified as a
war criminal by several non-governmental organizations and the United States
State Department. Inconceivably, immediately after declaring his own plan
dead, Mr. David Owen embraced Milosevic’s plan. A novel approach in healing
as well as diplomacy: Adopt the peace plan of the war-maker, subject the
victim to the criminals' goodwill and save a pluralistic nation by
partitioning it. If Bosnia and Herzegovina wanted to commit suicide, we would
not need the assistance of the Dr. Jack Kevorkian of mediation and diplomacy.
Even more incredibly, after having committed themselves and us to the
Vance-Owen peace plan, certain members of the European Community adopted
Mr. Owen's view because they were unwilling to confront the Serbians and to
pressure them for the adoption and implementation of the Vance-Owen plan.
Even though this so-called new peace plan calls for ethnic division, we are
now assured that this is net a partition plan. Nonetheless, Mr. Milosevic's
vision clearly portends partition and the eventual disintegration of Bosnia
and Herzegovina. Recent history, I suggest, has taught us that it is
Mr. Milosevic's view that has the greater commitment behind it. Nonetheless,
again we are told that, even if the new proposals fall far short of stated
goals, we must accept the diminished results.
We are now being urged to accept the new realities. Those who in fact
have actively endeavoured to limit our options nod tell us that we have no
other options. I ask His Excellency the representative of France: Could the
S/PV.3247
15
(Mr. Sacirbev, Bosnia and
Herzegovina)
French people have been convinced that Vichy France was an acceptable
alternative to the majesty of a free and sovereign France? Mr. President, is
it historically justified to ethnically partition a pluralistic,
multi-religious society that over 500 years ago was already a safe haven of
tolerance and multiculturalism when Jewish refugees, escaping the bigotry of
Western Europe and Spain, came to Bosnia? I ask His Excellency the
representative of the Russian Federation: did the defenders of Stalingrad
persevere to allow, 50 years later in Europe, the fascist siege of Sarajevo?
S/PV.3247
16
(Mr. Sacirbev, Bosnia
and Herzegovina)
To His Excellency the representative of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland, Sir David Hannay, I say that when
Sir Winston Churchill was being persuaded that he had no option but to
"capitulate to Hitler, he offered ""Give us the tools and we will finish the"
"job"". If that response is worthy of the British people, then I believe that"
the British people would agree it is also worthy of the Bosnians.
The Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina has waited for well over a year
for the most empowered members of the Security Council to fulfil their
commitment to confront the Serbians in the peacemaking effort. Only after
they failed to meet their commitment have we now sought to reassert our right
to obtain the means of self-defence.
It is not enough to feed us at a subsistence level while we continue to
be indiscriminately murdered. It is unethical to tell a hungry people that
they must sacrifice self-defence in order to be fed. But, if a choice is to
be made between humanitarian relief and self-defence, we have unequivocally
told the Council which option we choose.
To ignore the Bosnian people’s choice on this matter goes beyond
arrogance and seeks to mask the failure to honour responsibility.
The permanent members of the Security Council claim an elevated status on
the basis of their special commitment to the membership of the United Nations
to take the necessary measures to maintain international peace and security.
By their permanent membership of this body, and veto power, they are in a
position to dictate action or inaction.
In the case of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the permanent
members have failed in their special responsibility, but some of them continue
to insist on dictating life and death for Bosnia in a way that makes a mockery
S/PV.3247
17
(Mr. Sacirbev, Bosnia
and Herzegovina)
not only of the United Nations Charter, but of commitments made by this body a
mere three and a half weeks ago.
The Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina claims no special status within
the family of nations, but we do not agree to be reduced to a lower status so
that certain permanent members of the Security Council can carry on with the
illusion of their elevated responsibility.
Neither do we appreciate being treated with disdain because we dare to
challenge certain permanent members on their unique responsibility and status.
We are persuaded that we should be grateful for the selective
humanitarian aid that Bosnia receives, but we understand that this aid is a
meagre substitute for resolute action.
We also understand that while committed and courageous individuals
endeavour to save Bosnian lives on the ground the intended goal is in fact
protecting the public image of compromised leaders.
Whether peace is to come to Bosnia and Herzegovina through confrontation
or through negotiations with the aggressor, there is only one choice with
respect to this draft resolution: the Bosnians must be provided with the
leverage to undertake fair and promising negotiations, or, in the alternative,
to confront the undiminished aggression. So far Bosnia has not received this
assistance from the most prominent members of the Council. Therefore, the
Council does not have the authority to demand any further concessions from us,
but should only free us of the shackles that diminish our self-defence and our
capacity to pursue joint negotiations.
Mr. MARKER (Pakistan): The Pakistan delegation, together with those
of Cape Verde, Djibouti, Morocco and Venezuela, the other Non-Aligned members
of the Security Council, took the initiative of calling for this meeting of
S/PV.3247
18
(Mr. Marker, Pakistan)
the Security Council to address the tragedy of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. This situation poses a historical challenge to the international
community. What happens in Bosnia will significantly influence the entire
course of international relations in the post-cold-war era.
From the outset of the conflict in Bosnia it has been clear that this new
State Member of the United Nations was the victim of external aggression. An
unarmed Government was confronted by the might of the former Yugoslav army.
This aggression has been accompanied by grave atrocities - murder, rape and
genocide - carried out at the behest of the Serbian authorities, with a
pre-planned design to ethnically cleanse territories as a prelude to their
acquisition by force. The grand design of a Greater Serbia has been writ
large in the cruel military campaigns waged against the defenceless people of
Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina has remained at a grave
disadvantage to respond to this blatant aggression, not only because of the
large and well-equipped Serb army and paramilitary units employed against it,
but because it has been prevented by the United Nations itself from acquiring
the means for self-defence.
Over the past 18 months it has become clear to the world community that
the Serbian forces will not be deterred by the many exhortations and
admonitions of the Council so long as it is not prepared to take enforcement
measures, including the use of force under Chapter VII of the Charter.
Unfortunately, the Security Council has so far been unable to fulfil its
responsibilities under the Charter to halt the Serbian aggression, much less
to reverse it. Over the past year and a half the Council has acted in a
piecemeal fashion without addressing the core issue of Serbian aggression and
S/PV.3247
19
(Mr, Marker, Pakistan)
"the accompanying practice of ""ethnic cleansing"". At each step the Security"
Council has done too little and too late. Its lack of decisiveness, its
failure to enforce its decisions, its hesitation to respond effectively to the
Serbian atrocities, have emboldened the aggressor, which has continued to
conduct its brutal campaign against the Bosnian people with impunity.
As an active participant in the work of the Security Council on this
important matter since the beginning of this year, Pakistan is aware both of
the accomplishments and the difficulties that the Council has faced in dealing
with the complicated issue of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We are fully aware and
conscious of the fact that but for the presence of the United Nations
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and the Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other international humanitarian
agencies the casualties and death toll would have been far greater and far
more horrific than even the present lamentable figure. We salute the brave
men and women of UNPROFOR and the UNHCR, who work under conditions of
unimaginable and unprecedented hardship and danger, and recognize that their
bravery and dedication have saved literally thousands of men, women and
children from death by starvation, disease and indiscriminate bombardment.
My delegation is also conscious of the fact that some of the resolutions
passed by the Security Council have had a considerable impact on the
situation, particularly our resolutions on sanctions and on safe areas. I
should like to point out that Pakistan, together with other Non-Aligned
"members of the Council, was the initiator of the concept of ""safe areas"","
which led to the adoption of resolutions 819 (1993) and 824 (1993) as an
immediate response to an emergency situation in order to save lives. However,
the experience in Srebrenica, Zepa and Gorazde revealed the fundamental
S/PV.3247
20
(Mr. Marker, Pakistan)
shortcomings of this concept in the absence of the international community's
resolve to endorse the Vance-Owen Peace Plan.
Resolution 836 (1993), on which my delegation abstained, did not address
certain core issues of the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. It did not contain appropriate enforcement actions by the
Council in a given time frame and as a part of an overall plan. As presently
applied, the safe-area concept has become an instrument in freezing the
situation on the ground to the full advantage of the Serbs. The safe areas in
Bosnia and Herzegovina are no more than refugee camps. Most important of all,
the concept of safe areas is applicable to only about a third of what is left
of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The rest of the country remains
unprotected, defenceless and subject to constant attacks by the Serbian
aggressors.
S/PV.3247
21
(Mr. Marker, Pakistan)
Today we are faced with a situation where Serbian forces are occupying
over 70 per cent of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Moreover, the
Council's failure to respond to the Serbian aggression has also emboldened the
Croat forces to revive their campaign of territorial expansion in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. Croat forces now occupy over 20 per cent of the country, with
the Bosnian Government forces left in control of two separated areas and a few
isolated enclaves, which taken together constitute less than 10 per cent of
their State's territory.
This is a moment of grave trial for the people and the Government of
Bosnia and Herzegovina. The consequences of the pressures being exerted on
them are evident to all of us. At the same time, this is also a moment of
decision for the Security Council. Will the Organization's collective
capabilities be used to respond to this blatant aggression against a small
Member State which is being torn apart limb by limb, or will the international
community fail to respond to the genocide against the Bosnian Muslims and
accept the extinction of a sovereign State Member of the United Nations?
To accept a fait accompli, to subscribe to the so-called plan for the
partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina, would be a mistake of monumental and
historic proportions. The Security Council is the primary organ entrusted
with upholding international peace. It is the primary organ to ensure respect
for the provisions of the United Nations Charter. The Council surely cannot
accept and legitimize the consequences of such blatant acts of aggression
against a State Member of the United Nations. It cannot endorse the
S/PV.3247
22
(Mr. Marker, Pakistan)
"disintegration of a sovereign State. It cannot accept the results of ""ethnic"
"cleansing"" and the total liquidation of the Bosnian Muslims, who constitute"
over 46 per cent of the population of this multi-ethnic nation.
The consequences of accepting the so-called reality which has been
created in Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Serbian aggressor would be terrible
not only for the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina but for the international
community as a whole. This would encourage all those who believe that force
can be a viable instrument for territorial expansion and political
domination. It would erode the credibility of the Security Council as an
instrument for peace and justice not only as regards Bosnia and Herzegovina
but in all other conflicts and disputes. It would revive the global arms race
as all nations which are exposed to aggression and domination seek to arm
themselves against such threats. Finally, it would further incense the
Muslims of the world, who have witnessed the systematic slaughter of their
Bosnian brothers and sisters. Those in the Muslim world who believe that the
West has acquiesced in or even contributed to the defeat of the Bosnian
Muslims will be strengthened in their conviction. Those who believe that the
United Nations will use force only against Muslims but not in their defence
will feel fortified in their belief. If aggression is allowed to stand in
Bosnia, the forces of moderation will lose. The forces of extremism will be
strengthened.
I wish to make it clear that Pakistan and other Islamic countries will
not accept the virtual extermination of a Muslim people in the heart of a
continent that prides itself on its commitment to human rights and
international legality.
S/PV.3247
23
(Mr, Marker, Pakistan)
The Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) has consistently argued
for a comprehensive solution to the problem based on effective action by the
international community. The OIC declaration of 24 May 1993 called on the
world community and the Security Council to take decisive steps for peace in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. It proposed the following specific actions: first,
"lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina; second, use of force"
against heavy weapons that are being employed against civilian population
"centres in Bosnia and Herzegovina; third, interdiction of arms supplies to the"
"Serbs; fourth, revision of the mandate of the United Nations peace-keeping"
"forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina to enable them to take enforcement action;"
fifth, expansion of those forces by the addition of troops from other
"countries, including Islamic countries; sixth, early establishment of the"
"war-crimes Tribunal to deal with ""ethnic cleansing"" and to punish war crimes"
"and crimes against humanity; seventh, the safe return of the Bosnian refugees"
"to their homes under the peace arrangements for Bosnia and Herzegovina; and"
eighth, a decision by the Security Council and its permanent members not to
accept the unjust fait accompli in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The States members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference have
made it abundantly clear that, in their view, the Joint Action Programme
announced on 22 May 1993 did not address the core issues in Bosnia and
"Herzegovina and that the concept of ""safe areas"" approved by resolution"
"836 (1993) was flawed from the outset. Gorazde and other ""safe areas"" have"
been subjected to further Serbian aggression in flagrant violation of
resolution 836 (1993) and other Council decisions.
S/PV.3247
24
(Mr, Marker, Pakistan)
I would like to recall, however, that when the Council was asked to vote
on resolution 836 (1993) it was given solemn assurances that: any peace
settlement must be based on the principles contained in the Vance-Owen Plan,
"which remained valid; there can be no acceptance of the acquisition of"
"territory or alteration of borders by force; until the Serbs withdraw from the"
"land they have seized there can be no final settlement; the Joint Action"
Programme in the Washington Agreement is based on the principles of the London
Conference and is designed to maintain a momentum towards a political
"settlement; and as the situation developed, stronger measures were not ruled"
out.
But it is now abundantly evident that, as we feared, the uncertain
posture of the Council emboldened the Serbs to intensify their aggression.
They have been joined by the Croats. Together, they have now presented the
world with what they consider is a fait accompli, in the form of a partition
plan put forward by Presidents Milosovic and Tudjman. Interestingly, the
advocates of this so-called plan are the leaders of Zagreb and Belgrade. This
plan negates all the principles contained in the Vance-Owen Plan, all the
principles of the London Conference, all the principles of the resolutions
adopted by the Security Council, all the principles of the United Nations
Charter. The partition plan is a confirmation of the larger design: to carve
up and divide the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina between the Serbs and
the Croats. After 18 months of a most brutal and inhuman campaign against a
defenceless people, we are now told that this is the so-called new reality
based on the acceptance of acquisition of territory through the use of force
"and the practice of ""ethnic cleansing""."
S/PV.3247

(Mr, Marker, Pakistan)
The non-aligned members of the Security Council have proposed a draft
resolution, contained in document S/25997, with a view to retrieving the
situation, even at this, the eleventh hour. The draft resolution reaffirms,
in its preambular part, that a solution must be based on: immediate cessation
"of hostilities; withdrawal from the territories acquired by aggression, the"
"use of force and ""ethnic cleansing""; reversal of the consequences of the"
"reprehensible policy of ""ethnic cleansing"" and recognition of the right of all"
"Bosnian refugees to return to their homes; and restoration of the territorial"
integrity and unity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In paragraphs 1 and 2, it reaffirms the sovereignty, territorial
integrity and political independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and demands
that all hostilities against the territory of that State be halted forthwith
and that the consequences of aggression against it be reversed in accordance
with the principles just stated.
S/PV.3247
26
/Mr. Marker, Pakistan)
The most important provision of the resolution is to exempt the
Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the arms embargo
imposed on former Yugoslavia by Council resolution 713 (1991) in order to
enable it to exercise its inherent right of self-defence. This is a measure
which was proposed by a majority of the United Nations membership in General
Assembly resolution 47/121 of 18 December 1992. It has been consistently
advocated by the Islamic countries. It is entirely consistent with the United
Nations Charter, whose Article 51 reaffirms the inherent right of every Member
State to individual and collective self-defence.
The options available to the Security Council are stark: either the
international community, in accordance with the collective security system
envisaged in the Charter, takes effective measures to defend Bosnia and
Herzegovina or it should remove the shackles which prevent the victim from
exercising its inherent right to self-defence. Those responsible for
resisting this have, in fact, contributed to the slaughter of defenceless
Bosnian men, women and children. A State Member of this Organization is dying
in front of our eyes, and a people, the Bosnian Muslims, is being subjected to
a virtual holocaust. And that is the actual reality of the tragedy in the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): The next speaker is
the representative of Egypt, whom I invite to take a place at the Council
table and to make his statement.
Mr. ELARABY (Egypc) (interpretation from Arabic): Allow me, first
of all, to convey to you, Sir, my sincere congratulations on your assumption
of the presidency of the Council for this month. My thanks go also to your
predecessor, Ambassador Vorontsov, the Permanent Representative of the Russian
Federation, for the efforts he made during his presidency last month.
S/PV.3247
27
(Mr, Elaraby, Egypt)
The Security Council is today considering, once again, the situation in
the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Thus it is dealing with an extremely
grave problem for international relations now and in the future, a problem
that will certainly have an impact on the Council's credibility, in particular
because the successive, tragic incidents that have taken place on the ground
are taking place even though the new international order is supposed to
promote international legitimacy and ensure that the whole international
community respects the collective security measures provided for in the
Charter to defend the weakest countries among it.
The delegation of Egypt has already issued a warning about the dangers of
contradictions in positions and about the dangers of failing to adopt firm
measures in respect of Serbian aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Today, the delegation of Egypt once again draws the attention of the members
of the Security Council to the seriousness of the events having to do with the
question of Bosnia and Herzegovina, specifically, the international
community’s failure to deal with the aggression and armed attacks whereby the
aggressor, who is the strongest party, is consolidating his increasing
territorial gains at the expense of the victim.
The Security Council has adopted dozens of resolutions on Bosnia and
Herzegovina. However, they have not been implemented: several of them
contain contradictions between their provisions and their objectives. Today,
the representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina cited these very contradictions.
The international community has proposed to the parties to the conflict a plan
for an international settlement brokered by the two Co-Chairmen of the
International Peace Conference on the Former Yugoslavia. Many of the
Council's resolutions contain tacit approval of that plan, which had at the
S/PV.3247
28
(Mr, Elaraby, Egypt)
time been accepted by the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina and by the
Croats.
The Security Council has on several occasions called upon the Serbian
side to agree to the plan and to abide by it. That party, however, has
ignored the demands of the international community and, in contravention of
"Security Council resolutions, has continued its aggression; it has thus"
acquired, by force, most of the territory, towns and villages of the Republic
of Bosnia and Herzegovina. And still the Security Council has not forced the
Serb side to abide by the Council's resolutions adopted under Chapter VII of
the Charter.
Today, my delegation - and, in fact, the international community as a
whole - is asking itself the following question: what has become of the
international will and international legitimacy when the resolutions of the
Security Council go unimplemented? It is the credibility of this body that is
at stake today. International legitimacy is also held hostage if the Council
continues to accept having its resolutions held in contempt, if the members of
the Council continue to take the easy way out and avoid the strong options -
which would, of course, require fresh international efforts and perhaps some
slight sacrifice to maintain international peace and security - and if the
"Council simply tries to find a realistic and ""viable"" solution which, frankly"
speaking, means bowing to and accepting the fait accompli imposed by the
Serbian aggressor through military force and its major territorial gains.
The Security Council has adopted about 40 resolutions on the question of
Bosnia and Herzegovina. Today, it is high time that the Council reconsidered
its position and decided exactly what it should do now, at this very moment,
taking into account two considerations: firstly, what the parameters are for
S/PV.3247
29-30
(Mr, Elaraby, Egypt)
"the necessary solution; and, secondly, when it approves any settlement plan,"
the fact that as long as the fighting goes on in the territory of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, as long as there is an aggressor and a victim, any negotiated
settlement that may be reached will be unjust and, therefore, not viable or
lasting. Also, any settlement accepted by the international community must be
based on the principles which underpin international law and international
legitimacy, and those principles must be applied to all in an equitable manner
and without double standards.
That is why my delegation regrets the recent attempts to impose a
negotiated, unjust solution on the Muslim side, that is, on the Government of
Bosnia and Herzegovina.
S/PV.3247
31
(Mr. Elarabv, Egypt)
The recently proposed partition plan sounds several alarm bells at the
international level for the following reasons.
First, this plan means that the Security Council is reversing its stated
position on the need to implement all its resolutions affirming the importance
of preserving the territorial integrity and independence of Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
Let us recall that many of those resolutions were adopted under
Chapter VII of the Charter.
"Secondly, the Muslims in the ""safe areas"" will live cut off in some sort"
of separate camps, which means the dismantling of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina as an entity and the end of the real presence of a Muslim entity
in that State.
Thirdly, accepting partition on the basis of fait accompli amounts to
"consecrating the results of aggression on the one hand and of ""ethnic"
"cleansing"" on the other. This is in flagrant violation of international law"
as expressed in Security Council resolutions that affirm the rejection of
"territorial acguisition by force and ""ethnic cleansing""."
The Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is a State Member of the United
Nations. The Security Council must deal seriously with the tragedy faced by
that State so that, on the eve of the twenty-first century, international
silence does not become a stain on the conscience of humanity.
The logic of those who oppose lifting the arms embargo holds no water.
If there really were a cease-fire in effect, obligatory for all parties, then
and only then would the international community have to refrain from supplying
all sides with arms. But the present situation is not like that. As long as
the fighting continues and as long as one party possesses all kinds of heavy
S/PV.3247
32
(Mr. Elarabv, Egypt)
weaponry while the other is defenceless, having not even the means to defend
itself, the international community must intervene to protect the weaker party
and allow it to exercise its right to self-defence.
The delegation of Egypt has co-sponsored the draft resolution contained
"in document S/25997; we call upon all Council members to adopt it."
The Security Council has not thus far put an end to the crimes being
perpetrated in full view and with the full knowledge of the international
"community; it has not adopted a clear plan to put an end to the fighting; it"
"has not decreed an immediate, mandatory cease-fire; it has not dispatched"
military forces to impose a cease-fire. The hostilities continue, and the
aggressor, the stronger party, has made major territorial gains.
Allow me, therefore, to address some questions to the Council, questions
that everyone is asking. Would the Security Council preserve some semblance
of credibility if it failied to adopt strong measures to prevent this
"aggression? Who is occupying the land of others? Who is carrying out ""ethnic"
"cleansing""? Who is perpetrating the most ignoble war crimes imaginable?"
The 15 members of the Security Council are now faced with a historic
responsibility. My delegation hopes they will live up to its responsibility
in order to preserve the Council's future credibility.
May we venture humbly to hope that the Security Council will lift the
embargo so that the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a State Member of the
United Nations, can be given a last chance to exercise its right to
self-defence, a right enshrined in the Charter?
"""Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of"
"individual or collective self-defence... ."" (Article 51)"
S/PV.3247
33
(Mr. Elaraby, Egypt)
The adoption of today's resolution will demonstrate the Council's will to
discharge its responsibilities under the Charter for the maintenance of
international peace and security. Will we continue to deny the people of
Bosnia and Herzegovina their right to self-defence? It is up to the Council
to decide that question.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the
representative of Egypt for his kind words addressed to me.
The next speaker is the representative of Croatia. I invite him to take
a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr. NOBILO (Croatia): I should like to take this opportunity to
commend you, Mr. President, on your prudent and exceptional leadership in your
capacity as President of the Security Council for the month of June.
The Republic of Croatia was the first country to provide assistance to
the Bosnian Croats and Muslims in their legitimate defence against Serbian
"aggression and ""ethnic cleansing"". Most of the Muslims who escaped Serbian"
slaughter and fled to Croatia and other countries did so through the territory
defended by Bosnian Croats. The Bosnian Croats even built the only road
through the mountains in order to save the refugees and provide international
humanitarian assistance. Croatia initiated defence cooperation with the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was formalized in two agreements.
Croatia has helped hundreds of thousands of Bosnian refugees to reach other
countries and at present shelters 271,000 Muslim refugees on its soil.
Without the support of the Bosnian Croats at the referendum for the
independence of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which the Serbs
boycotted, the Bosnian Muslims would not have been able to win the vote
alone. The tragic breakup of the Croatian-Muslim defence alliance started
S/PV.3247
34-35
(Mr. Nobilo, Croatia)
when 100,000 Muslim refugees, who were hosted in predominantly Croatian areas,
were used by some Muslim political and military leaders to try to establish
political and military control over the Croatian community of Herceg-Bosna,
which was formed by the Bosnian Croats as a provisional structure to organize
their defence and fill the legal and economic vacuum in the country.
The Bosnian Croat leaders, however, stated that they would be ready to
abolish that structure once the Vance-Owen plan began to be implemented in the
Croatian and Muslim provinces, as a start of the overall process.
Unfortunately, the Security Council never endorsed the Vance-Owen plan, nor
was it ready to enforce it. As a result, the divided international community
was again humiliated by the Serbian obstruction of this plan, although they
signed it in Athens on 2 May 1993. Similarly, the so called Cutileiro plan,
which was most similar to the latest peace initiative for Bosnia and
Herzegovina, was also signed by all three parties in March 1992, but
President Izetbegovic later withdrew his signature. The divided international
community shares the biggest responsibility for the anarchy that followed, in
which all three sides are now fighting one another in order to secure living
space.
The fact that Muslims have, unfortunately, been the principal victims of
Serbian aggression in the former Yugoslavia does not give them the right to
"continue with their policy of ""ethnic cleansing"" in central Bosnia, from which"
tens of thousands of Croats have been expelled and where thousands have been
killed.
S/PV.3247
36
(Mr. Nobilo, Croatia)
Regrettably, the Security Council has never discussed this humanitarian
tragedy affecting the Croats in central Bosnia. Some local units of the
Croatian Defence Council (HVO) are now finding themselves and their families
enclosed in pockets which are surrounded by rampaging Muslim forces, causing
local commanders to adopt emergency measures that, although contradictory to
the stated HVO policy, represent desperate acts aimed at pure survival.
The international community must stop the tragedy which is occurring in
the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. But we do not believe that providing
more arms to the Bosnian Muslims would accomplish that purpose. Of course,
the imposition of the arms embargo against the victims of Serbian aggression
was a wrong decision. Particularly cynical was the decision of the
international mediators to allow the withdrawal of most of the arsenal of the
Yugoslav army from Slovenia and Croatia to Bosnia and Herzegovina. My
Government has supported the lifting of the arms embargo as a measure
complementary to an international military intervention which would provide
air and naval support for the joint defence efforts of the Bosnian Croats and
Muslims, which would be conducted in cooperation with the Republic of
Croatia. Unfortunately, this solution was not accepted, nor was our offer to
put observers along all the borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Faced with these realities, Croatia has launched a peace initiative
designed to preserve the international sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina
while reorganizing it into three confederal units. What we need is a
Switzerland of the Balkans and not a new Lebanon in the heart of Europe.
S/PV.3247
37
(Mr, Nobilo, Croatia)
Unfortunately, after all thf destruction and horriole crimes which have been
committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, there are no ideal solutions which
present themselves. We need acceptable solutions for all three constitutive
nations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially for the .Muslims, who have
suffered the most in this war. The Croatian peace initiative is the last
chance to end the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We ask the international community to call on all sides to adhere
strictly to the cease-fire agreement of 15 June. We also ask the
international community to urge President Izetbegovic to join the other
members of the collective presidency at the negotiating table in Geneva and to
support the plan for peace.
If there is to be a lifting of the arms embargo, the Croatian Government
can only support a general lifting for all the victims of Serbian aggression.
A selective approach to this issue will only aggravate the ongoing situation,
and it would only mean more war in Bosnia. My Government is not prepared to
be an endless hostage to the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is
blocking the attainment of peace in the occupied territories of the Republic
of Croatia.
We also believe that tiere will be no genuine and lasting peace in the
region until the territorial integrity of all Member States in the region is
fully respected and their peaceful coexistence and cooperation are restored.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the
representative of Croatia for the kind words he addressed to me.
The next speaker is th: representative of Malaysia. I invite him to take
a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
S/PV.3247
38
Mr. RAZALI (Malaysia): The Malaysian delegation would like to thank
you, Mr. President, and the members of the Security Council for giving us the
opportunity to speak this afternoon.
There have been more than 40 resolutions adopted by the Security Council
since 1991 to address aggression and genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina. None
of these resolutions has been effectively implemented. Basically, the Council
has failed in its responsibility under Article 24 of the Charter to take
prompt and effective action to restore international peace and stability.
The choice for the Security Council in addressing the Bosnian issue now,
when genocide continues and a Member of the United Nations is being
dismembered is clear: either it takes more determined and concrete action in
accordance with its primary responsiblity under Article 24 of the Charter,
"using all the powers available under Chapter VII; or it lifts the arms"
embargo, which will allow the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina to exercise
its inherent right to individual and collective self-defence. No one can
dispute the fact that the arms embargo in reality has affected only the
Bosnians, and the Council's denial of the exercise of this right has led to
the slaughtering of the Bosnians, denying them their most fundamental right -
that is, the right to life itself. It should be pointed out that the
application of the arms embargo on the Government of the Republic of Bosnia
and Herzegovina is wrongly directed, as resolution 713 (1991) was adopted
before the Republic became independent of former Yugoslavia and joined as the
one hundred and seventieth Member of the United Nations, on 22 May 1992.
Coming to the Council once again, the Malaysian delegation finds it
necessary to appeal to the conscience and moral judgement of each member of
the Council over what further steps have to be taken to save Bosnia and
S/PV.3247
39
(Mr, Razali. Malaysia)
Herzegovina. The members of the Council must take into account two
resolutions of the General Assembly - resolution 46/242 and resolution
47/121 - that were adopted with big majorities and that underlined the
collective stand that the Bosnians must be allowed to have recourse to arms to
defend themselves. Recently, at the World Conference on Human Rights in
Vienna, a special declaration with a direct appeal to the Security Council was
adopted, calling for the lifting of the arms embargo for the Bosnians.
Council members cannot dismiss out of hand or be oblivious of the moral
question before them: can a handful of countries in the Security Council
continue to not even reconsider the possibility of reviewing the arms embargo,
in the light of a huge chorus of appeals from the international community?
Regrettably, the intransigent position of a few countries is the obstacle
to a review of resolution 713 (1991). Bosnia and Herzegovina, ironically
enough and with tragic consequences, is a problem in Europe that Europeans
have failed to solve but they are, at the same time, insistent that there can
be no other means except those undertaken by certain countries of Europe
themselves. We are seeing now the realization of our worst fears as a result
of that situation: the virtual abandonment of the Vance-Owen plan in favour
of the Milosevic-Tudjman proposal for the partitioning of Bosnia and
Herzegovina into three states based on ethnic lines. Although full details of
the proposal are not yet available, its acceptance means legitimizing Serbian
acquisition of territory through the use of force and the abhorrent practice
of ethnic cleansing.
S/PV.3247
40
(Mr. Razali, Malaysia)
As we meet here at United Nations Headquarters in New York, the Serbians
and Croatians are launching joint attacks to grab more territory by force, in
fulfilment of the Milosevic-Tudjman plan to dismember Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Europe must realize full well that what the Serbs and Croats want is a total
surrender by the Bosnian Muslims.
My delegation would also appeal to individual Council members to examine
again the premise behind the decision to adopt resolution 713 (1991) on the
arms embargo. That resolution was predicated on the Security Council's being
able to take effective steps to stop the strife and push back aggression.
Those things never happened. On the contrary, at a cost borne by hundreds of
thousands, and with immense tragedy, the dismemberment of Bosnia is in
progress. Is resolution 713 (1991) still applicable to the Bosnians who are
fighting for their lives? There is an argument being promoted that lifting
the arms embargo for the Bosnians would lead to a greater escalation of
violence, would affect humanitarian efforts and would threaten the concept of
safe havens. My delegation appeals to Council members to examine this
argument clearly. What further intensifications of fighting can one envisage
when already there have been thousands killed and the Bosnians are huddled
pitifully in places of refuge and their territory has shrunk into divided
pockets of survival? What humanitarian efforts are we to safeguard when
humanitarianism has been totally abandoned by an appeasement policy that has
allowed armies their full sway? What is the future of safe havens when the
rest of Bosnia and Herzegovina is being allowed to be swallowed up?
S/PV.3247
41
(Mr. Razali, Malaysia)
The single thrust of this draft resolution today is to give the Bosnians
their inherent right under Article 51 to defend themselves. The draft
resolution before us today is not expected to be adopted because a handful of
members continue to insist that they must determine the course of action on
the issue. Other Council members must reject this highly untenable situation
now and restore to the Bosnians their right to self-defense.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): The next speaker is
the representative of Jordan. I invite him to take a place at the Council
table and to make his statement.
Mr. ABU ODEH (Jordan) (interpretation from Arabic): It is on behalf
of the Arab Group, of which my country has the honour to be Chairman for this
month, that I have asked to speak at this meeting devoted to a general debate
on the armed conflict that continues to rage in the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
Before I take up the subject, permit me first to congratulate you, Sir,
on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for this month
and to express the confidence of the Arab Group in your wisdom, skills,
experience and leadership. Please permit me also to express the gratitude and
appreciation of the Arab Group to your predecessor, Ambassador Yuliy Vorontsov
of the Russian Federation, for the skill and ability he demonstrated in
guiding the deliberations of the Council during his presidency last month.
This is not the first time that the Council has devoted a meeting to a
debate on the tragic situation in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. If
anything, this fact simply demonstrates the failure of the resolutions adopted
by the Council to put and end to aggression against this helpless country, to
check the aggressor and to nullify the consequences of its aggression.
S/PV.3247
42
(Mr. Abu Odeh, Jordan)
I do not want to recount the facts, which by their very nature, sequence
and evolution, have come to be known today as the first human tragedy of the
post-cold-war world. Suffice it to say that the systematic killing,
"displacement and ""ethnic cleansing"" inflicted upon the Muslim people of Bosnia"
and Herzegovina and the violation of the human dignity of its men, women and
children have reached a level that will stigmatize humanity for many centuries
to come. This aspect of the Bosnian tragedy, however, is only its first
chapter.
The second chapter is characterized by the prevarication of the United
Nations beating about the bush, unable to take any steps forward - steps
provided for in the Charter - while the Serbian aggression was escalating and
continues to escalate. The abject failure of the United Nations to carry out
the duties entrusted to it by the Charter has brought about a strange paradox
that can be neither overlooked nor denied. This paradox is best manifested in
the fact that the more the Serbian aggression escalates the more the United
Nations retreats. This fact has been reflected not only in the expansion and
intensification of the Serbian aggression and the increase in the number of
aggressors, but also in the ongoing peace efforts themselves and in the
features of the proposed peace plans, which are being altered so as to serve
the fait accompli created by the success of aggression. If this rhythm
continues, the end result nay be not only the displacement of the people of
Bosnia and Herzegovina and the infliction upon them of all kinds of pain and
suffering but also the destruction of their Republic and its disappearance
from the international map. The United Nations will then become a witness to
death and extinction rather than a protector of life and survival.
S/PV.3247
43
(Mr, Abu Odeh, Jordan)
Why has the situation reached this tragic and dangerous level? There are
many different interpretations of this, some public, others hidden. Numerous
as they are, the public arguments boil down to the fact that influential and
powerful countries, as is well known to everybody, have seen fit to deal with
the tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina within the framework of their financial
calculations and perceived interests, completely ignoring their ethical, moral
and legal responsibilities, as well as all the grandiose slogans they proclaim
here at the United Nations about laying the foundations of a world in which
security and freedom can prevail and in which nations can pursue the goals of
development and prosperity. Why have these Governments deviated and adopted
this standard, despite the fact that it is clearly incompatible with the basic
responsibilities of the United Nations and the Security Council in particular?
The answer to that is not known, and it must be included among the hidden
reasons.
While the Serbs and the Security Council are the protagonists of the
first and second chapters of the tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the whole
world is being pushed against its will to be the protagonist of the third,
which has yet to be written although it has gradually begun to take shape
already. If the United Nations continues to act by the same rhythm that has
brought the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina to its current stage, and if
the Security Council continues to beat about the bush or to mark time, the
third chapter will be written and the tragedy will be complete. Its
dimensions will go beyond the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina to encompass
all the peoples of the world. Thus will be dissipated the hopes that these
people cherished as they entered the post-cold-war era, to be replaced by
misgivings about the new world order. These misgivings will be reflected in a
number of valid questions.
S/PV.3247
44-45
(Mr. Abu Odeh, Jordan)
Is there more than one possible reading of the Charter of the United
Nations? Is the double standard in dealing with international problems the
rule and even-handedness the exception? What will be the fate of small
nations? What will be the fate of weak States adjacent to powerful ones? Is
the persistent call for the protection of human rights a serious one or is it
a political ploy? Are we justified in hoping for international cooperation
and interdependence? Must the national security of a State be enmeshed in
the intensification of great-Power interests in the country, even at the
expense of the development and prosperity of its people? Are we sliding into
an abyss of neo-colonialism as we approach the fiftieth anniversary of the
United Nations? Do Muslims have a special status - a negative one - in
international relations? Must we announce to our peoples that the world is
returning to the Middle Ages and not approaching the threshold of the
twenty-first century?
Does the Security Council realize the ramifications of grudges among
peoples, especially if they accumulate on a religous basis, at a time when
socio-economic frustrations are growing? Will the United Nations bring about
the fulfilment of the prophecy of the American political scientist
Samuel Huntington, who argues that the conflicts of the post-cold-war era will
flare up along the fault lines of civilizations, Islam being one of them?
What will the new world order look like if these are its features? Can we
trust it? Indeed, can it be established on solid foundations? Is it really
possible to deal with the various urgent issues that crowd the international
agenda? Lastly, what will be the fate of international peace and security?
S/PV.3247
46
(Mr, Abu Odeh, Jordan)
The misgivings on these questions are the salient features of chapter III
in the tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Arab States, which uphold the
Charter of the United Nations and abide by its provisions, do not wish to see
this chapter written, because they want to live in a world where peace and
security prevail and where confidence in its international institutions is
widely felt. They see that the path to that world is still open and that the
Council still has the opportunity to prevent the tragedy from reaching its
horrible conclusion. The features of this path, as seen by the Arab States,
are numerous. The most outstanding is the exemption of the Republic of Bosnia
and Herzegovina from Security Council resolution 713 (1991), which bans the
shipment of arms to the former Yugoslavia.
It is most ironic to say that the exemption of the Republic of Bosnia
Herzegovina from that resolution would only increase the number of killings
and losses. To say that would mean only one thing: to tolerate the killing
of Bosnian Muslims and not to accept the killing of Serbian aggressors. So
let the victim bleed, but the aggressor must remain healthy and sound.	What
kind of logic is that? Do those who uphold this option suppose that the
continued bleeding of the Bosnian people will evoke mercy in the heart of the
"Serbian aggressor who perpetrates the crimes of ""ethnic cleansing"", thereby"
motivating it to stop its aggression?
It is high time, Mr. President, for your Council to stop denying the
Republic of Bosnia and Hercegovina its legitimate right of self-defence in
accordance with Article 51 of the Charter. There is not one reasonable
argument that can convince us of the validity of the opinion that calls for
denying the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina the right to self-defence.

(Mr, Abu Odeh, Jordan)
It was understood right from the beginning that the adoption of the arms
embargo resolution, resolution 713 (1991) by the Security Council implied
that the United Nations itself would undertake on behalf of the victim the
task of repelling the aggressor. As this has not so far been the case, the
Council’s continuation of the arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina means
that the United Nations does not respect its Charter and that dealing with
Muslims is based on another handbook.
Does the Security Council intend to establish this perception? Is this
the way to consolidate the foundations of international peace and security?
In conclusion. Sir, I wish your Council every success.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the
representative of Jordan for his kind words addressed to me.
Mr, SNOUSSI (Morocco) (interpretation from French): Since the
outbreak of the armed conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina the situation has
only become worse. The suffering and the loss of human lives have increased,
despite the efforts of the international community and the measures adopted by
the Security Council, the principal organ of the United Nations entrusted with
the maintenance of international peace and security. This terrible, continued
deterioration of the situation is still a major concern for my country and all
other countries committed, as we are, to the principles of the Charter.
This grave threat to international peace and security has become a major
concern for the international community, which has been called upon to take
the appropriate measures in the framework of the system of collective security
to put an end to aggression and prevent an expansion of the conflict. The
international community in fact faces a very serious situation in which the
sovereignty, territorial integrity and very existence of a young State Member
S/PV.3247
48
(Mr. Snoussi, Morocco)
of our Organization, Bosnia and Herzegovina, are seriously threatened, in
flagrant violation of the principles of international law and the Charter of
the United Nations.
The impressive number of resolutions, some under Chapter VII of the
Charter, and the no less impressive number of presidential statements,
demonstrate, if it were necessary to demonstrate this, that the Security
Council and other United Nations organs have done everything possible to do
their duty and face up to what is, tragically, a runaway situation. A
peace-keeping force has been deployed and a sanctions regime has been decreed,
permitting some reduction in human suffering, thanks to the distribution of
humanitarian aid in conditions that are often dangerous.
The international community responded spontaneously by sending
contingents to support the distribution of aid and, now, to protect the safe
areas. My delegation takes this opportunity to express its appreciation of
the tireless efforts of the Secretary-General and the two Co-Chairmen of the
London Conference, and we pay a warm tribute to the men and women of the
United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and the personnel of the Office of
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and humanitarian
organizations working in that country, for their attitude, for the sacrifice
and courage they have constantly shown in the past two years, risking their
lives and braving every danger to perform their duties.
"Despite all that, our appeals have not been heeded; the aggressor has"
disregarded our statements and resolutions, which have remained a dead
letter. In fact, contrary to all the Council’s dacisions, the Serbs continue
"cynically to implement their policy of ""ethnic cleansing"", expelling Muslim"
populations and occupying territory. They have thus occupied more than two
S/PV.3247
49
(Mr. Snoussi, Morocco)
thirds of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, caused the loss of more
than 150,000 human lives and forced more than a million people to leave the
country. Furthermore, even resolutions adopted to ensure the distribution of
relief have been violated daily by the Serbs.
In recent days the violence has intensified in central Bosnia. This time
the Croats have added their violence to that long perpetrated by the Serbs.
Devastation and massacres of civilian populations - particularly of the Muslim
peoples - are increasing. According to the latest information from the
Secretariat, humanitarian aid is now encountering insurmountable obstacles,
and there is a danger of its not being distributed if vigorous measures are
not taken immediately.
In brief, the international community, which is responsible for ensuring
the territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, has not, unfortunately, succeeded in implementing measures
decided on, and the mission of the United Nations organ responsible for the
maintenance of international peace and security has been constantly blocked by
the intransigence of the Serbs, who take advantage of their military
"superiority to pursue the shameful policy of ""ethnic cleansing"" and occupation"
based on intolerance and hate.
We had hoped that the process of a peaceful settlement, begun at the
London Conference, would put an end to the tragedy of the Bosnians. Sadly,
the situation has gone from bad to worse. The international community does
not want to, and must not, reward aggression and give legitimacy to faits
accomplis.
The arms embargo decreed by the Security Council with a view to reducing
the violence and suffering has never, unfortunately, had any effect on either
S/PV.3247
50
(Mr. Snoussi, Morocco)
the Serbs or the Croats. Ca the contrary, it has increased the Serbs military
superiority and intensified their intransigence and their bellicose stance.
As long as this imbalance exists the Serbs will continue to impose their
conditions and refuse to compromise, as they have with respect to the
Vance-Owen Plan, which they have killed. They are now trying to substitute
for it a machiavellian plan for dismemberment, which is no more and no less
than a repudiation of 40 resolutions, 40 statements, which we uphold and in
which we have always said that Bosnian sovereignty is sacred.
The legitimate Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina has suffered most
from the arms embargo. Lacking the means for defence, that Government has
not, unfortunately, succeeded in maintaining its territorial integrity or
ensuring respect for its independence, still less its sovereignty.
S/PV.3247
51
(Mr. Snoussi, Morocco)
Nor has the international community been able to help the Bosnian
Government succeed, although that Government deserved encouragement for its
cooperation and flexibility during the Vance-Owen talks.
In these circumstances, we believe that authorizing the Bosnian
Government to acquire the means to defend its civilian population would help
deter the Serbs from their aggression and their policy of occupation. This
new measure should be coupled with other deterrent measures we have considered
with a view to convincing the Serbs to abandon their sordid designs. Indeed,
the right of self-defence is formally embodied in Article 51 of the Charter,
which states that
"""Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of"
individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a
"Member of the United Nations""."
In the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina, several Security Council
resolutions have recognized that that State Member of the United Nations is
indeed the victim of Serbian hostilities, which have not been ended by the
measures adopted by the Security Council.
It is therefore essential to supplement those measures by authorizing
Bosnia and Herzegovina to obtain the means needed for self-defence and
exempting it from the provisions of resolution 713 (1991), which puts in place
the embargo. To avoid any distortions or harmful effects, the lifting of the
arms embargo should be accompanied by possible strengthened monitoring of the
sanctions regime to prevent the Serbian aggressors from continuing to acquire
additional weapons or additional territory.
S/PV.3247
52
(Mr. Snoussi, Morocco)
This action must supplement, not negate measures already adopted by the
Security Council. Lifting the embargo will certainly discourage the Serbs
from attacking the safe areas we have established.
In our view, this is likely to bring about the balance needed to ensure
that negotiations lead to a compromise solution that could preserve the
territorial integrity and independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Let there be no doubt: we support lifting the embargo because we view
this as a logical defensive measure. As we have been unable to defend Bosnia
we must at least allow it to defend itself.
Unfortunately, this is an act of despair. We want to lift the embargo
because we have been able to do nothing else we had wished to do. The
Bosnians have always been a peace-loving people, but they have been invaded
"and dispossessed; their women have been raped; they have been placed in"
"concentration camps; the Serbs have taken everything. Today like yesterday"
"the Bosnians do not want war; they merely want to live. It is in our power to"
"give them that right; we cannot refuse it."
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): The next speaker is
the representative of Albania. I invite him to take a place at the Council
table and to make his statement.
Mr. SHKURTI (Albania): As this is my first statement before the
Council during your presidency. Sir, allow me to congratulate you on your
successful work during this month. I should also like to pay a tribute to
Ambassador Yuliy Vorontsov of the Russian Federation for his skilful guidance
of the Council during its deliberations last month.
S/PV.3247
53
(Mr. Shkurti, Albania)
For a long time the international community has been shocked at what is
going on in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since the day the aggression against the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina started, the situation on the ground has
remained the same. Massive killing of Muslims as a result of fighting and the
"heavy daily shelling of Muslim-inhabited areas; ""ethnic cleansing"" carried out"
"by force of arms; massive destruction of the homes and property of Muslims;"
"genocide against them; massive rape of Muslim women; the tragic humanitarian"
situation prevailing in Bosnia and Herzegovina: those are some of the
elements and consequences of the tragedy going on in that country.
The aggression and the civil war there have put at stake the very
existence of a State Member of the world Organization. The efforts of the
international community to bring about peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina have
proved ineffective. The Security Council has adopted a great number of
resolutions concerning the Yugoslav crisis and the conflict in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, but they have all been unavailing.
The Security Council, however, conscious of its responsibility under
Chapter VII of the Charter, should take the appropriate steps, with a view to
bringing the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina to an immediate end. We hold that
a just solution to the conflict in that country should be based on the
"following principles: immediate cessation of hostilities; withdrawal from the"
"occupied territories; international guarantees of the return of refugees to"
"their homes; restoration of the territorial integrity and unity of the"
"Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina; and the immediate trial of the"
perpetrators of crimes of genocide and of grave breaches of international
humanitarian law.
S/PV.3247
54
(Mr. Shkurti, Albania)
The Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina must be allowed to exercise its
inherent right to self-defence, as embodied in Article 51 of the Charter. The
Security Council must at least lift the arms embargo against the Government of
the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, thus giving the unarmed Muslim people
the opportunity to defend themselves and contributing to their survival, which
is at a critical point today.
The adoption of the proposed draft resolution would be a clear signal to
the Serbs that the international community is no longer going to tolerate the
massacres in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The failure of the international
community to bring an end to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina could on the
"one hand encourage the Serbs to continue the war to achieve a ""Greater Serbia"""
and on the other encourage them to expand the massacres in other areas of the
former Yugoslavia, such as Kosovo, where the situation is extremely grave and
explosive.
The international community must, in a timely and appropriate manner, act
to stop aggressive Serbian nationalism in order to prevent a Balkan war with
grave consequences for the region.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the
representative of Albania for the kind words he addressed to me.
The next speaker is the representative of Indonesia. I invite him to
take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr. WISNUMURTI (Indonesia): Let me at the outset extend my
delegation's congratulations to you. Sir, on your assumption of the presidency
of the Council for this month. We are confident that under your able
guidance, the Council's deliberations will be brought to a successful
conclusion
S/PV.3247
55
(Mr. Wisnumurti, Indonesia)
I should like also to pay a well-deserved tribute to your predecessor.
Ambassador Yuliy Vorontsov of the Russian Federation, for the able guidance
and leadership he provided to the Council last month.
Let me also take this opportunity to express our appreciation to the
members of the Council for giving us the opportunity to participate in this
debate.
It is with a deepening sense of distress and grief that we in the
Non-Aligned Movement have watched the tragedy that is unfolding in the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Ever since the eruption of hostilities
more than a year ago, a State Member of the United Nations has been subjected
to unabated aggression, with a horrendous toll in human life and material
devastation. We have witnessed systematic attempts progressively to decimate
"a people through the unconscionable policy of ""ethnic cleansing"" and the"
massive violation of basic human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Consequently, two thirds of Bosnian territory has now come under Serbian
occupation, while the few remaining towns under Bosnian control are under
relentless bombardment, resulting in even more death and destruction, forced
expulsions, mass starvation and the denial of desperately needed humanitarian
aid and assistance.
S/PV.3247
56
(Mr. Wisnumurti, Indonesia)
For over a year now, the Council has been seized of the rapidly
deteriorating situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and has adopted numerous
resolutions, always in the hope of terminating the conflict. Thus, the
embargo on weapons, the imposition of economic sanctions, the ban on military
flights over Bosnia's air space, as well as the decision to facilitate
humanitarian aid and the establishment of safe areas, have justifiably
heightened the expectations of many Member States that those measures would
suffice to end the aggression, halt the genocide and end the forcible land
grab. To our profound regret, however, those decisions have been met with
contempt and scorn, and have emboldened the aggressors to intensify the
brutalization of a defenceless people, particularly when the Council demurred
at taking enforcement action.
The announcement of the Joint Action Programme last month in Washington
has further compounded the situation. We have serious doubts concerning how
effective it will be to implement the Vance-Owen plan on a step-by-step basis,
which is the concept underlying the Joint Action Programme.
Furthermore, the cynical plan advanced by the aggressors would partition
Bosnia and Herzegovina in utter disregard of the sacrosanct principle of the
inviolability of the territorial integrity of States and would herd its people
into less than a tenth of their territory: it is a blatant attempt to divide
Bosnia and Herzegovina along ethnic lines and create States-within-a-State
that would take the Bosnian Serbs closer to their proclaimed goal of an
independent State that would ultimately link with the former Yugoslavia to
"form a ""Greater Serbia"". It would codify and reward aggression; it would"
"result in an enforced transfer of population; it would ignite an already"
explosive situation and further undermine the stability of the region. Hence,
S/PV.3247
57
(Mr, Wisnumurti, Indonesia)
we should categorically reject the insidious design to partition Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
In my Government's view, a settlement of the crisis in Bosnia and
Herzegovina can brook no further delay. We can no longer procrastinate. Of
"immediate importance are the implementation of an effective cease-fire; the"
"reinforcement of humanitarian operations; an end to the bombardment of"
civilian populations and the surrender of heavy weapons to the peace-keeping
forces. Furthermore, the Vance-Owen plan, along with its constitutional
principles, the provisional map, interim as well as peace arrangements, must
be implemented, as it constitutes a viable modality for peacefully resolving
the conflict.
The plan spells out terms for a cease-fire, the separation of combatants
and the demilitarization of the country. Taken together, the plan and its
principles recognize that Bosnia and Herzegovina will be a decentralized
State, with most governing functions to be carried out by the provinces.
Although the plan represents an enforced compromise between the aggressors and
their victims, the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina has nonetheless
accepted the proposals contained therein in the cause of peace and of saving
lives.
The Government and people of Bosnia and Herzegovina have been subjected
to continued and intensified bombardment while Bosnians have been deprived of
their inherent right to self-defence. How long will the international
community tolerate killings, murder and genocide against the people of Bosnia
and Herzegovina while the S arbs make a mockery of the efforts to attain a
peaceful settlement of the arisis? Since the international community - or
some of its members - has been unwilling or unable to defeat the aggression
S/PV.3247
58
(Mr, Wisnumurti, Indonesia)
perpetrated against a sovereign State, there is a moral responsibility not to
deny that State the right to defend itself.
The arms embargo was in fact instrumental in facilitating the land grab,
"the ""ethnic cleansing"" and the process towards the creation of a ""Greater"
"Serbia"". Thus, the arms embargo has proven to be largely ineffective in"
ending the Serbian onslaught: it has tied the hands of Bosnian Muslims in the
face of the overwhelming military advantage enjoyed by the Bosnian Serbs, and
has enabled the Bosnian Serbs to proceed with their devious plans, which are
devoid of any humanitarian considerations.
Lifting the arms embargo would render the Serbian policy of territorial
"acquisition by the use of force much more costly; hence, the contention that"
even a selective lifting of the embargo would be counter-productive and might
even lead to a widening of the conflict can no longer be sustained. At a
minimum, therefore, the embargo against the Bosnian Government should be
lifted.
Against the backdrop of the grave situation prevailing in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, the World Conference on Human Rights held this month in Vienna
adopted a special declaration and urged the Security Council to fulfil its
responsibilities under the Charter, especially those under Article 24, and
thereby restore the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In conclusion, Indonesia and other non-aligned countries are firmly
committed to the peaceful settlement of disputes. We believe that a renewal
of dialogue in good faith i i essential to resolve this crisis and that a
negotiated solution within the framework of appropriate international
S/PV.3247
59
(Mr. Wisnumurti, Indonesia)
mechanisms is still within reach. But it is self-evident that the aggressors
have become increasingly brazen and contemptuous of those who are trying to
"end the carnage; hence, the Council can no longer remain passive in the face"
of the defiance or flouting of the international will. The decisions taken
now may well reverberate beyond the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina and
determine the course of events in the post-cold-war era. The imperative need,
then, is the for the United Nations peace-keeping forces in Bosnia and
Herzegovina to be strengthened for enforcement action under the provisions of
Chapter VII of the Charter.
The draft resolution of the non-aligned caucus now before the Council
reaffirms the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Bosnia
and Herzegovina. I fully concur with the statement made by the coordinator of
the caucus when he so eloquently introduced the draft resolution. The draft
resolution also calls for the arms embargo to be lifted for the sole purpose
of enabling Bosnia and Herzegovina to exercise its inherent right to self-
defence. It is my delegation's earnest hope that this draft resolution, if
implemented in full, will lead to an immediate end to this agonizing conflict
and will also provide a long-term solution to the crisis.
I am pleased to convey the request of my Government that Indonesia be
included in the list of sponsors of draft resolution S/25997.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the
representative of Indonesia for his kind words addressed to me.
The next speaker is the representative of Turkey, whom I invite to take a
place at the Council table and to make his statement now.
S/PV.3247
60
Mr. BURCUOGLU (Turkey): On several occasions in the past year, and
most recently on 4 June, we voiced, before this body, our deep anguish over
the inability of the Security Council to protect the Bosnian Muslims from
genocide and to act effectively against Serbian defiance of Security Council
resolutions. We called for the use of force to stop Serbian aggression if
resolutions adopted by the Council under Chapter VII of the United Nations
Charter were incapable of doing so, and we stressed that Bosnia and
Herzegovina should be exempted without delay from the arms embargo so long as
the ruthless attacks on the defenceless Muslims continued unabated.
The Council is finally considering, at a crucial moment, whether it will
acknowledge the inherent right of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a
State Member of the United Nations, to self-defence under Article 51 of the
Charter, and allow the Bosnian Muslims to meet their legitimate defence
needs. We commend the members of the non-aligned caucus for submitting the
draft resolution contained in document S/25997 on the exemption of Bosnia and
Herzegovina from the arms embargo. We strongly support the draft resolution,
which we have also decided co co-sponsor.
S/PV.3247
61
(Mr. Burcuoglu, Turkey)
The World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna just recently made a
consensus appeal to the Security Council to take the necessary measures to end
the genocide taking place in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Along with many others,
including two resolutions of the General Assembly, this appeal would not have
been necessary had the Security Council taken up the challenge and responded
adequately to the Serbian aggression. It is precisely the lack of such
decisive action that has encouraged the aggressors to drive the imperilled
Bosnian Muslims into practical extinction. The Security Council must now
fulfil its moral and legal obligations under the Charter and heed the united
appeal made by the international community in Vienna. Abandoning the Bosnian
Muslims to the mercy of the aggressors would be acting against the will of the
membership of the United Nations, which the Security Council, under article 24
of the Charter, represents, The will of a large majority of members of the
United Nations to lift the arms embargo was reflected in General Assembly
resolution 47/121 and, most recently, in the Declaration adopted by the World
Conference on Human Rights. The Security Council must act accordingly and no
longer deny the Bosnian Government its right to defend itself .
In practical terms, the arms embargo imposed on the former Yugoslavia by
resolution 713 (1991) has affected only the Bosnian Government. We all know
that the other parties to the conflict have vast means to arm themselves.
While the Council has reaffirmed on several occasions, in words if not in
deeds, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina and rejected the acquisition of territory through the use of force
"and the practice of ""ethnic cleansing"", it cannot remain indifferent to the"
right of that country, whose very existence is at stake, to procure defensive
weaponry. My Government cannot accept such inconsistencies.
S/PV.3247
62
(Mr. Burcuoglu, Turkey)
"The concept of ""safe areas"" was based on the expectation that resolutions"
establishing them would be effectively and immediately implemented. If the
"Serbs are allowed to shell these ""safe areas"", impede the delivery of"
humanitarian assistance to them, block the flow of vital water supplies and
continue to face no consequences for their crimes, what credibility will the
"Council have as the protector of the Muslim population ""imprisoned"" in these"
"areas? Why should the Muslim population confined as refugees in ""safe"
"areas"" - together with those living in ""non-safe areas"" - be denied the right"
to defend themselves, while their aggressors move freely about and prepare for
the final kill? What logic is there in declaring safe enclaves if they
continue to be attacked?
Those opposed to lifting the arms embargo must accept the fact that the
Bosnian nation is now being slowly exterminated by its neighbours seeking to
legitimize territorial acquisitions made through the use of brutal force and
"the genocidal practice of ""ethnic cleansing"". The Vance-Owen plan has now"
been mutilated and killed, leaving the Security Council face to face with the
eventual outcome of acknowledging defeat by surrogate thugs and warlords. The
carving up of Bosnia has been brought closer. We believe it would be fair to
ask under what authority the Co-Chairmen appear to be involved in an exercise
designed to dismember the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We are awaiting
a strong reaction from the Council to this deviation.
With what faith remains in us, we earnestly hope that wisdom will
prevail, that the Bosnian Muslims will be granted rightful protection by the
international community and that their inherent right to self-defence will be
recognized. Thereafter we shall draw the necessary conclusions on whether the
Security Council is truly representative of the will of the international
S/PV.3247
63
(Mr, Burcuoglu, Turkey)
Community or whether it will legitimize the rule of might over right. Turkey
is convinced that at this critical juncture the international community bears
not only the responsibility for what has happened so far in Bosnia and
Herzegovina but also the responsibility for shaping Europe and the world of
the twenty-first century.
No natter what today's deliberations yield, Turkey shall continue to
pursue actively the course of justice and legitimacy to support the
beleaguered and brave people of Bosnia and Herzegovina in their struggle for
survival.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): The next speaker is
the representative of Afghanistan. I invite him to take a place at the
Council table and to make his statement.
Mr. FARHADI (Afghanistan) (interpretation from French): I
congratulate you, Mr President, on your outstanding leadership of the work of
the Council during the month of June.
Once again we are considering a very sensitive point of contemporary
history that touches the international community, especially the United
Nations and the Security Council. In this particular case the Council has
shown a tendency to diverge from the conception of it held by peoples that
have believed in the United Nations. Peoples want to believe that the United
Nations will clearly and vigorously support the cause of justice in the face
of injustice.
The facts show that, quite to the contrary, such is often not the course
of action chosen by the Security Council. Does the Security Council not tend
systematically to take refuje in morally vapid half-measures, as if there were
a need to strike a balance between justice and injustice, as if the question
S/PV.3247
64-65
(Mr. Farhadi, Afghanistan)
were one of equating aggression and resistance to aggression, between
aggressor and aggrieved.
The great Powers know perfectly well that the Milosevic regime in
Belgrade and the Serbian regular forces and militias are the indisputable
authors of the overwhelming majority human rights abuses, atrocities and
killings that have taken place in Bosnia. To say that the various parties to
the conflict share responsibility for large numbers of atrocities and war
crimes and that they are thus responsible to the same degree is to resort to
sophistry in order to provide an excuse for doing nothing to face up to the
Bosnian Serbs, who continue to commit these atrocities and crimes. The great
Powers are officially and perfectly well informed about the war crimes
committed by the Bosnian Serbs.
Let us recall that following the Second World War the Yugoslav army was
the largest Communist army in Eastern Europe, second only to that of the
Soviet Union. It remained a large army, and in recent years Milosevic and the
partisans of his regime, who are chauvinistic expansionists, have made the
"Yugoslav army the essential instrument for the creation of a ""greater Serbia"
and for fighting against non-Serbs in Croatia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia and
Vojvodina.
S/PV.3247
66
(Mr. Farhadi, Afghanistan)
Over these years, an infernal war machine has been set up by the Serbs in
the former Yugoslavia, and particularly in Bosnia. Enormous sums have been
spent to establish Serb militias in Bosnia. That is the kind of barbarism we
have at the end of the twentieth century in Europe.
The majority of the Yugoslav army's officer corps has been made up of
Serbian nationals, and an almost inexhaustible arsenal of weapons is made
"available to the militias; it has been piling up for years. The United"
Nations embargo has had no effect on the racist, chauvinistic plan for Greater
Serbia. They have enough weapons to continue this carnage for years.
Let us be clear about this: the embargo is in fact practised against the
Bosnian Muslims and is implemented by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO). In fact, this is potentially indirect military assistance to the
Bosnian Serbs.
So, are we really to have the same concern for the occupier as for the
occupied, if not more? Are we to go so far as to spare the attacker as much
as the victim? Are we to go to the point of having as much concern for the
Bosnian Serb aggressors as for the Bosnians who are being attacked, interned
and executed and whose ancestral homes are being dynamited and places of
worship being burned - this people that is witnessing the systematic breaking
up and dismemberment of its territory?
The international community never tires of hiding behind methods of
compromise and accommodation, of engaging in machinations and deals at the
expense of a single victim nation. And it goes even further: it has as much
regard for the person who r ipes as for the person who is raped. Deprived of
the means of defending itself, a country fights for its honour - and thus for
the honour of the human being, of Europe and of the international community -
while the aggressor is already armed to the teeth. All this is, of course,
S/PV.3247
67
(Mr. Farhadi, Afghanistan)
a way for the great Powers cf the world just to let things happen and let
things alone, going so far as to become witnesses - so-called impartial
witnesses - to the carnage committed against the moral and spiritual
conscience of mankind.
That is the tragic panorama, sometimes described - as was done today by

by the former Soviet Union were characterized by this mentality of arranging
texts in such a way as to make a fundamentally unequal equation between the
agressor and the victim of the aggression. That left 1,700,000 victims in
Afghanistan, and almost totally destroyed the country's economy. And now,
after the end of the cold war, life is hell in Bosnia, where the Muslims are
suffering the same kind of carnage as took place in Afhanistan.
S/PV.3247

(Mr, Farhadi, Afghanistan)
Thus, does the end of the cold war mean that small nations are to be
sacrificed at the altar of a peace arranged between the large nations? Are we
now in a phase of history when witnessing the death throes of a people has
become the habitual attitude of the powerful of our world?
During the past few months, every time a positive solution has been put
forward in the form of an idea or a draft, every time a particular method has
evolved and has been judged effective, its adoption has been postponed because
one, two or three great Powers have not had the agreement of their
Government. This is procrastination established in the form of indecision, of
obvious lack of determination hidden under the pretext of realism and even
so-called wisdom. All this has turned the Security Council into a
semi-attentive spectator that closes its eyes to genocide and war crimes.
We hear talk about the new reality - the Ambassador of Bosnia reminded us
of this. The most recent new reality consists in leaving the Bosnian Muslims
in zones which, practically speaking, would be concentration camps.
It will soon be a half century since the United Nations was established.
The Organization has, to be sure, rendered important service to mankind. But
in regard to formerly occupied Afghanistan, in regard to Bosnia, the victim of
ethnic - or, actually, religious - aggression, the Security Council has been
an instrument for depriving the victim of the possiblity of obtaining the
means to defend itself. If that is indeed the role of this principal organ of
the United Nations, the conscience of mankind will have to quote the following
"Arab proverb to the Organization: ""You are certainly in a valley, but I am in"
"quite another one"". But the conscience of mankind and the conscience of this"
Organization should be together, in the same valley. It is up to the great
Powers to bring this about.
S/PV.3247
69-70
(Mr, Farhadi, Afghanistan)
As long ago as 16 November 1992, the delegation of Afghanistan stated to
the Security Council that resolution 713 (1991), adopted in September 1991 -
the resolution at the basis of the problem - did not pertain to Bosnia and
Herzegovina at that time and continued not to pertain to Bosnia because the
question of the war in Bosnia emerged in April 1992. In September 1991 it was
a question of an armed conflict between Croatia and Serbia.
S/PV.3247
71
(Mr. Farhadi, Afghanistan)
The resolution of September 1991 specifically refers to a certain
Yugoslavia, which legally no longer exists. The text of resolution 713 (1991)
is therefore null and void. The only priority of the jurists of these
countries, on this and other points as well, is the policies of their
Governments. Thus, legally, operative paragraph 3 of the draft resolution
(S/25997) before us today, of which we are a co-sponsor, simply clarifies the
fact that the resolution of September 1991 does not concern Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
History will show with sadness and astonishment that while, in a historic
capital of Europe, Vienna, the representatives of European countries and the
great Powers were preaching about human rights, in the Security Council in New
York not one important country dared to say that the Muslims of Bosnia have a
right to live and hence the right to possess the means of defending their
lives against these over-armed aggressors. On 19 April, my delegation, in
reference to the arms embargo, told the Security Council:
"""It must be made possible for Bosnian Muslims to untie their hands, to"
"receive arms in order to defend their lives and the honour of humanity."""
(S/PV.3201, p. 72)
On that day, my delegation also said that the sanctions of resolution
820 (1993), of 7 April, are inadequate and insufficient. We said that the
text hinted at certain timid, hesitant measures which some powerful countries
"call ""realism"" - a realism that does nothing but allow the Bosnian Serbs a"
free hand.
The Security Council is shouldering a great responsibility. Let us
recall what happened at Versailles in the aftermath of the First World War.
The injustice committed and tolerated in the case of some peoples of Europe
S/PV.3247
72
(Mr. Farhadi. Afghanistan)
and the Middle East was the source of tragic events a few decades later,
events which exacted a heavy cost on Europe and the world. It is important
that we draw a lesson from history. What is happening in Bosnia can happen,
as has just been stated by the representative of Albania, in neighbouring
territories. Europe and the international community will suffer the
consequences. Let us therefore stop allowing the Serb aggressor to make dead
letters of all the decisions of the United Nations. Let us stop allowing free
rein to the aggressor. Let us allow Bosnia to live. Let us allow Bosnia the
means to defend itself and, in defending itself, Bosnia will defend our most
sincere ideals.
"The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish); I thank the"
representative of Afghanistan for his kind words addressed to me.
The next speaker is the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
I invite him to take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr, KHARRAZI (Islamic Republic of Iran): Allow me to congratulate
you. Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for the month of
June. I am confident that your wisdom and vast diplomatic skills will
effectively guide our deliberations on the tragic and deteriorating situation
in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I would like to take this opportunity to thank
Ambassador Yuliy Vorontsov of the Russian Federation for his able guidance of
the Council last month.
The tragedy in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, marked by
genocidal Serbian aggression against the Muslim population of that country,
has escalated to extremely disturbing levels. Over the past few weeks, the
Serbian aggressors have continuously intensified their acts of aggression
against the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina through the abhorent policy of
S/PV.3247
73
(Mr, Kharrazi, Islamic
Republic of Iran)
"""ethnic cleansing"", the killing of defenceless people and the mass deportation"
of civilians. Even those cities which have been declared by the Council to be
"""safe areas"" continue to be subjected to massive daily shelling by the Serbs."
Undoubtedly, this situation calls for urgent and resolute action on the
part of the international community. However, the 39 resolutions and 33
statements adopted by the Security Council on the conflict in Bosnia and
Herzegovina have failed to reverse the Serbian aggression and war crimes which
have been so systematically perpetrated against the people of Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
A review of the Security Council attitude towards this brutal uprooting
and gradual extinction of a young Member of the United Nations reveals clearly
that a passive approach and a policy characterized by double standards,
appeasement and leniency towards the aggressor have prevented the
international community from establishing justice. This has allowed the
aggressor to dictate its terms to the Security Council and to continue its
aggression with impunity. Therefore, not surprisingly, the Security Council
has been unable to fulfil its responsibilities under the Charter of the United
Nations to halt the Serbian aggression, much less to reverse it. Indeed, had
the Security Council acted decisively and expeditiously when the Serbs started
their aggression, as it did in the course of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, we
"would not be facing the continuation of the insolent policy of ""ethnic"
"cleansing"", its legitimization and the alarming possibility of the"
dismemberment of a State Member of our Organization.
"When resolution 836 (1993) on ""safe areas"" was adopted, the international"
community was assured by the sponsors of that resolution that a peace
S/PV.3247
74-75
(Mr, Kharrazi, Islamic
Republic of Iran)
settlement must be based on the principles contained in the peace plan of the
Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the
Former Yugoslavia and that there can be no acceptance of the acquisition of
territory or alteration of borders by force. However, these promises did not
change the deteriorating situation on the ground and the Serbian aggressors
"have continued their atrocities unchecked. The establishment of ""safe areas"""
which was first viewed to be not only a meagre palliative but also a first
step towards defeating Serbian aggression and restoring the sovereignty,
territorial integrity and political independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina has
now been interpreted by the Serbs as a euphemism for refugee camps and the
capitulation of the Muslim people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
S/PV.3247
76
(Mr. Kharrazi, Islamic
Republic of Iran)
The Islamic Republic of Iran, together with an overwhelming majority of
other Member States, has warned about and rejected any intention to use the
"""safe areas"" in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina as permanent refugee"
camps which would perpetuate the fruits of aggression, occupation and
territorial gains.
The Security Council stands at a crucial stage of the assessment of its
ability to maintain international peace and security. It has already had
recourse to peripheral measures to tackle the Serbian aggression, but has
refused to invoke the necessary and primary ones. It is evident that the
Security Council has not provided collective security to protect the Republic
of Bosnia and Herzegovina against Serbian assaults and atrocities. Moreover,
it has backed an arms embargo that prevents the Government of Bosnia and
Herzegovina from acguiring weapons adequate for self-defence.
The proposals jointly put forward by the Croats and Serbs aim, in
essence, largely to freeze the present status quo and seek to legitimize the
territorial gains made by them through the use of force and the practice of
"""ethnic cleansing"". It is high time for the Council to remedy its past"
mistakes. The Security Council must immediately, without further delay, take
all necessary measures to stop the genocide and reverse the aggression. The
Council has moral, political and legal obligations to respond in an effective
manner to the will of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina - a sovereign
Member State which is nearing extinction.
"In this context, the I ;lamic Republic of Iran supports the draft"
resolution, which, among other things, recognizes the inherent right of Bosnia
and Herzegovina, as a State Member of the United Nations, to individual and
S/PV.3247
77
(Mr. Kharrazi, Islamic
Republic of Iran)
collective self-defence as stipulated in Article 51 of the Charter. It needs
to be emphasized that the draft resolution once adopted will strengthen the
many previous resolutions and decisions of the Security Council, including
resolution 836 (1993).
The critical question is whether the Security Council should be guided by
political expedience or by the human conscience, which is wounded and shocked
by the heinous crimes of the Serbs. How will history judge the Security
Council if it fails to proceed with plans aimed at ensuring the survival of a
State Member of the United Nations and reversing the Serbian aggression?
Undoubtedly, insufficient action by the Security Council at this crucial stage
will call into serious doubt the authority of this organ for the maintenance
of international peace and security. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the
Security Council to act decisively, if it is not to be judged as an organ
applying double standards in dealing with different issues.
In conclusion, I should like to request that the Islamic Republic of Iran
be included in the list of co-sponsors of the draft resolution, document
S/25997.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the
representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran for his kind words addressed to
me.
The next speaker is the representative of the United Arab Emirates. I
invite him to take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr, SAMHAN (United Arab Emirates) (interpretation from Arabic): On
behalf of the United Arab Emirates and the other countries of the Gulf
Cooperation Council, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and the Sultanate
S/PV.3247
78
(Mr. Samhan, United Arab
Emirates)
of Oman, I have pleasure at the outset. Sir, in extending our congratulations
to you on your presidency of the Security Council for this month. We are
fully confident that thanks to your wide diplomatic experience and your
expertise and skill the Council’s work will be successfully concluded. I also
wish to take this opportunity to extend to your predecessor, the Ambassador of
the Russian Federation, our appreciation of his presidency of the Council last
month.
The Security Council is once again meeting to deal with the tragic
situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Council has discussed the matter
before and adopted a number of resolutions and approved presidential
statements on the issue. Previous speakers have unanimously agreed in
diagnosing the current situation that it will have a grave impact on
international peace and security as a result of the current military
aggression, which is continuing, perpetrated by the Serbs, supported by the
regular armed forces of Serbia and Montenegro, against the people of Bosnia
and Herzegovina, particularly the Muslims there. The whole world has been
"shocked by the horrible tragedy; it is a real shock to the conscience of every"
person who is looking forward to a propitious international environment in
which coexistence, peace and stability may prevail among the peoples of the
world.
The latest events demonstrate that the Serbs will not voluntarily abandon
"their atrocious campaign of ""ethnic cleansing"", or their objective, which is"
"the establishment of ""Greater Serbia"". They have taken advantage of peace"
initiatives and negotiations that are still going on as a cover for inhuman
violations and practices and for aggressive expansionist policies, in
withstanding any pressures from the international community.
S/PV.3247
79-80
(Mr, Samhan, United Arab
Emirates)
In view of all that, the failure of the current diplomatic efforts and
the absence of any evidence that the Serbs are thinking of putting an end to
their brutal, criminal, aggressive policies, or even of implementing Security
Council resolutions, we are more than ever convinced that there is no
political or legal pretext to justify the continued arms embargo imposed on
Bosnia and Herzegovina.
At their latest summit meeting, held in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab
Emirates, the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council stated:
"""The Council affirm their full support for Bosnia and Herzegovina in"
its painful ordeal and in its heroic defence of its territorial
integrity, independence and sovereignty, and requests the Security
Council to lift the arms embargo imposed on Bosnia and Herzegovina so
that it may face up to the aggressor and exercise its legitimate right to
self-defence, a matter which complies with Article 51 of the Charter of
the United Nations. They also call upon the international community to
extend all possible forms of assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina based
on the fact that deterring aggression is a collective international
responsibility. They call upon the international community to take a
unified firm stance in implementation of the Council's resolutions as
"well as resolutions of the London Conference."""
S/PV.3247
81
(Mr. Samhan, United
Arab Emirates)
We note also that at its forty-seventh session the General Assembly
adopted resolution 47/121, which reaffirmed the right of Bosnia and
Herzegovina to self-defence in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter.
That resolution reflects international legality and the collective will of the
majority of States Members of the United Nations. It also, inter alia, states
the need to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina to enable it
to exercise its legitimate right to self-defence and to restore its
sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence. The Security
Council should adopt a similar resolution upholding the principles of the
Charter and international law.
The World Conference on Human Rights, held recently at Vienna,
"categorically condemned the continued aggression, ""ethnic cleansing"" and"
genocide perpetrated against Bosnia and Herzegovina. It called for the
lifting of the arms embargo imposed on Bosnia and Herzegovina so that it could
exercise its right to self-defence. The Conference also called for a halt to
arms supplies to Serb forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It affirmed the need
to restore the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Bosnia
and Herzegovina.
The Gulf Cooperation Council believes that the embargo imposed by the
United Nations on the former Yugoslavia is clearly intended to apply to
"aggressors; it should not deprive the victims of aggression of their right to"
self-defence. Acquiescing in this serious situation and doing nothing to
rectify it, at a time when the Serbs are receiving heavy weapons and other
military supplies that enable them to tighten their grip on the territories
S/PV.3247
82
(Mr, Samhan, United
Arab Emirates)
they have acquired by force, constitutes an acceptance of the policy of
"""ethnic cleansing"" and aggression, which poses a threat to international peace"
and security and violates the sovereignty of a State Member of the United
Nations. That is a grave situation which runs counter to international law
and the Charter.
It is most important that there be an end to further bloodshed, rape and
displacement, and to Serb military attacks against innocent civilians,
particularly Muslims. It is vital that the sieges against villages and towns
be lifted and that international efforts to protect the safe areas be
strengthened, in conformity with Security Council resolutions.
The solutions for which we are calling are in accordance with the Charter
and international law and would ensure respect for the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of States and non-recognition of aggression and the
acquisition of territory by force.
In our view, the responsibility for the maintenance of international
peace and security is a collective one in which the Security Council has a
paramount role to play. We must not let a handful of people with religious,
national or ethnic biases, supported by Serbia and Montenegro, continue their
"violations against the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina; that would be"
contrary to the fundamental principles of the Charter and all the norms
governing international relations.
The Gulf Cooperation Council believes that the draft resolution before
the Council is the minimum it can accept in the effort to solve the problem.
Lifting the embargo would be aimed not only at letting Bosnia and Herzegovina
S/PV.3247
83
(Mr. Samhan, United
Arab Emirates)
exercise its right to self-defence, but also at defending international
legality as represented in the Charter and at enhancing the credibility of the
United Nations and particularly the Security Council with respect to the
maintenance of international peace and security.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the
representative of the United Arab Emirates for the kind words he addressed to
me.
The next speaker is the representative of Senegal. I invite him to take
a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr. SY (Senegal) (interpretation from French): The delegation of
Senegal - a country with excellent relations of friendship and cooperation
with your country. Sir - is pleased to see you presiding over the work of the
Council this month - a task you are carrying out with ability, selflessness
and skill. As I warmly congratulate you, I want to reaffirm our total support
as you endeavour to find good solutions to the important issues before the
Council.
Our congratulations go also to your predecessor. His Excellency
Ambassador Yuliy Vorontsov, Permanent Representative of the Russian
Federation, for his remarkable work last month.
I want finally to thank all the members of the Council for this
opportunity to participate in this important debate on the tragic situation in
Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The aggression perpetrated by the Serbs against the Republic of Bosnia
and Herzegovina, and the ensuing violations of international humanitarian law,
S/PV.3247
84
(Mr. Sy, Senegal)
"the most serious of which is ""ethnic cleansing"", has now attained proportions"
that yet again challenge our collective conscience. The daily deterioration
of the situation in that country is all the more intolerable because it
clearly stems from the systematic refusal by the Serbs to abide by the
numerous Security Council resolutions on this matter.
The Serbs have met with contempt and arrogance the Vance-Owen Peace Plan,
which was accepted and signed by two of the three parties involved and on
which the international community had pinned great hopes. Yet I would recall
that that Plan had always teen put forward as the only and the best solution.
Frequently, the Plan had even served as a pretext for discouraging the Bosnian
authorities from requesting that the embargo imposed on the former Yugoslavia
by resolution 713 (1991) be lifted in the case of their country to enable it
under Article 51 of the Charter to engage in self-defence. The proponents of
this thesis, once the Plan was signed and accepted, promised by all means
available, including the use of force, to make the Serb side to go along with
the Plan.
Hence, when it was announced that those two parties had accepted the Plan
we hoped sincerely that Bosnia and Herzegovina and its people would finally
regain peace and security. We anticipated determined action by the Security
Council to impose its authority and put an end to this deplorable conflict.
We were extremely disappointed when the Serb side, its actions having gone
unpunished, simply continued its aggression, indulging in the luxury of
proposing the replacement of the Vance-Owen Plan with a bald partition of
Bosnia and Herzegovina into three republics delineated on ethnic lines.
S/PV.3247
85
(Mr. Sy, Senegal)
If the Security Council accepts that proposal, it will have enshrined the
fait accompli desired by the aggressor, whose ultimate purpose is without
doubt to wipe Bosnia and Herzegovina off the map against the sovereign will
and deep-seated aspirations of its people, as freely expressed when it founded
the Republic.
For its part, Senegal cannot endorse such an approach, especially since
our Head of State, His Excellency Mr. Abdou Diouf, current Chairman of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, has consistently drawn the attention
of the international community to this risk and to the need to take the
measures necessary to find a good and just solution to this question, one
based on respect for law and on equity.
S/PV.3247
86
(Mr. Sy, Senegal)
This solution, and I repeat it formally here, must necessarily be based
"on an immediate cessation of hostilities; the withdrawal by the Serbs from the"
"territories they have occupied by force; compensation for the consequences of"
"""ethnic cleansing"" and, specifically, the return of the refugees to their"
"homes; and, lastly, the restoration of the territorial integrity of the"
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In our view, the Security Council has the duty and the responsibility to
put an end to the genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to ensure peace and
security there. It has that duty, because, as a sage once put it, its
principal mission is that of preventing this world, with its greed and its
injustices, from resembling hell. The Council must cause peace and security
to reign so that the Earth becomes a haven of perfect peace where there is no
more greed, hate, ignorance, suffering or obscurantism. In Bosnia and
Herzegovina, as indeed everywhere else that human lives are threatened, the
Council must ensure that wisdom enlightens all minds and that the gentle rain
of compassion waters all hearts to transform the blood that has been spilled
into the milk of human kindness, and cruelty into respect for human dignity
and the rule of law. This is the most ardent hope that we should have liked
to see the Security Council fulfil in Bosnia and Herzegovina, without
foot-dragging or hesitation, or any sign of acquiescence or culpable weakness.
What has been happening in that country for more than a year now has,
however, caused us to have our doubts, as all the Security Council's
resolutions, including resolutions 713 (1991), 757 (1992), 824 (1993) and
836 (1993), have been ignored and flouted by the aggressor. The lack of a
sufficient and appropriate reaction to this attitude of scorn and defiance
towards the international community has certainly compounded the tribulations
of the people of that country.
S/PV.3247
87
(Mr. Sy, Senegal)
The Security Council’s persistent wish to deny the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina its right to self-defence as authorized under Article 51 of the
United Nations Charter is paradoxically rewarding the aggressor, who, despite
the military embargo, has always had the benefit of weapons of every kind.
The Security Council has, unfortunately, enabled the aggressor to expand and
consolidate his territorial gains, in violation of the principles and ideals
of the Charter of our Organization, which the Security Council is none the
less obliged to uphold.
The Security Council's inability - or rather, its lack of political
will - to impose a cease-fire on the forces of aggression in order to bring
them to seek a negotiated solution is on the point of creating - and will
create, if we are not careful - a precedent that is dangerous, particularly
for a world in the throes of change where confrontation must give way to
peaceful coexistence and the selfishness of States to genuine international
solidarity. We also run the risk of opening the door to all sorts of
dangerous ventures based on goals similar to those openly being pursued by the
Serbs.
In conclusion, I should like to reaffirm that we would have preferred
there to be a strict application of the Security Council's resolutions, but
the fact remains that the Council has not yet given us any meaningful proof of
its determination to act along such lines, even though it has already proved
that it does have the means to do so.
Also, time is not on the side of the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina and
the survival of its people. We therefore feel that urgent counter-measures
must be taken, including lifting the military embargo against Bosnia and
Herzegovina which, all things considered, applies to that country alone.
S/PV.3247
88
(Mr. Sy, Senegal)
This step is in no way contradictory to pursuing the peace efforts
because, in an armed conflict, one cannot prevent one party, let alone the
victim of known aggression, acquiring the necessary means to ensure its
self-defence while the other party continues to arm and to expand its
territorial conquests with a view, even if it does not achieve its sinister
design, of at least considerably strengthening its position in possible
negotiations.
This is the real thrust of the draft resolution before the Council, which
we support wholeheartedly and are sponsoring for the reasons I have mentioned,
in the sincere hope that the Security Council will adopt it. By doing so, the
Council would send a message of deterrence to the Serbian side, whereas if it
does not, it would hand it another incentive to persist in its intransigence
and in its contempt for the law and for the force of reason.
I am sure that, faced with this choice, the Council will take the right
decision, or risk seriously damaging its credibility, which is more than ever
threatened, and dashing the many hopes that have been rested on it.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the
representative of Senegal for his kind words addressed to me.
In accordance with the decision taken earlier in the meeting, I now
invite Ambassador Dragomir Djokic to take a place at the Council table and to
make his statement.
S/PV.3247
89
Mr. DJOKIC: The Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
strongly opposes exempting one side involved in the civil war in Bosnia and
Herzegovina from the arms embargo imposed by Security Council
resolution 713 (1991). Such a proposal, as an example of political myopia,, is
not only unacceptable but is fraught with danger and would result in the
continuation and further escalation of the civil, inter-ethnic and religious
war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Should the proposed draft resolution be
adopted, the Security Council would, under the false pretext of protecting the
exercise of the inherent right of self-defence, merely contravene its past
efforts to contain the crisis and find a lasting political solution. As a
result, Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is already replete with arms, would be
engulfed with even more weapons and destruction, resulting in further
killings, atrocities and suffering by the innocent.
Lifting the arms embargo and supplying arms to one side would invariably
lead to an arms race between the warring parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
with unforeseeable consequences. It would be erroneous to assume that arming
the Muslim forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina would lead to peace: on the
contrary, it would surely represent a serious setback to a political
settlement. Those sponsoring the draft resolution are evidently not committed
to a peaceful resolution of the conflict, but are instead trying to achieve
their own limited political objectives. It is particularly disturbing and sad
that this initiative has come at a moment when the peace process, after a long
stalemate, is showing signs of progress towards a settlement based on the
vital interests of all three sides.
S/PV.3247
90
(Mr. Djokic)
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is rendering its full contribution to
a peaceful and just resolution of the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Despite the unfair and inhumane sanctions that have unjustly been imposed
against my country, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which is not a party
to the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, will spare no effort to help
prevent further bloodshed between the three constituent nations and to find a
solution based on their legitimate interests and rights.
S/PV.3247
91
(Mr. Diokic)
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia accords absolute priority to the
immediate and unconditional cessation of hostilities in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. It is our firm conviction that there is no alternative to an
overall political settlement and that the international community and the
United Nations, including the Security Council, should do everything in their
power to facilitate a negotiated settlement and encourage the Bosnian parties
to reach one.
At a time when intensive and constructive negotiations are under way in
Geneva, the adoption of this draft resolution, regardless of its motives,
would take us farther from that goal.
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is committed to helping the Bosnian
parties find the road to a just peace on the basis of equal respect for the
legitimate rights of all three constitutent peoples.
The proposed draft resolution is one of war rather than peace. We would
therefore hope that the Security Council, which under the Charter bears the
primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and
security, will be guided by the noble principles enshrined in it and will not
adopt the proposed draft resolution.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of
Ukraine, in which he requests to be invited to participate in the discussion
of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that representative to
participate in the discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
S/PV.3247

At the invitation of the President, Mr, Khandogy (Ukraine) took the place
reserved for him at the side of the Council Chamber.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): The next speaker is
the representative of Algeria. I invite him to take a place at the Council
table and to make his statement.
Mr. HADID (Algeria) (interpretation from French): Allow me first of
all to express to you, Sir, the satisfaction of the Algerian delegation on
seeing you presiding over the Council this month with your well-known
effectiveness and ability. I must also pay tribute to your predecessor,
Ambassador Vorontsov of the Russian Federation, for his outstanding
stewardship of the Council during the month of May.
I must also say that I fully agree with the statements of the
representatives of Indonesia and Jordan, speaking here in the capacity of
President of the Non-Aligned Movement and on behalf of the Arab Group in the
United Nations, respectively.
Once again the Security Council finds itself face to face with its
responsibilities relating to the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, now more
tragic than ever.
After more than a year of effort, discussion and negotiation, punctuated
by more than three dozen resolutions and just as many statements, the balance
sheet of international action gives little cause for satisfaction and offers
little hope for the future.
Half-measures, procrastination and divisions within the international
community in the face of this situation of blatant aggression provide no
justice for the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a State Member of the
United Nations. Nor do they respond to the essential need for stability in
S/PV.3247
93
(Mr. Hadid, Algeria)
the Balkan region, over which still hovers the risk of a major conflagration
with incalculable casualties.
Even more serious, the Security Council is apparently being asked to
acquiesce in a process, now openly under way, of carving up the territory of
the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, thus departing from a cardinal
principle of international relations that has been reaffirmed so many times
here:	the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territories by force.
"Moreover, the unspeakable practice of ""ethnic cleansing"" and the"
atrocities suffered by the Muslim population continue, assuming the
proportions of genocide, as even the International Court of Justice has
declared.
The provision of humanitarian aid is still being systematically and
deliberately impeded. United Nations personnel themselves, who constitute the
peace-keeping force, are subjected to constant attacks, despite the repeated
warnings of the Council.
Algeria feels that it must reiterate its support for and solidarity with
the Bosnian Government in the defence of its sovereignty, territorial
integrity and independence as a State Member of the United Nations. We stress
that it is incumbent on the international community, primarily the Security
Council, to ensure respect for the purposes and principles of the United
Nations Charter, sparing no effort to end aggression and restore justice and
the rule of law.
Algeria fully supports the clear positions of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference and the initiatives of the non-aligned countries, which
expect the Security Council to defend law and justice wherever they are
threatened and to abandon the policy of the double standard.
S/PV.3247
94
(Mr. Hadid, Algeria)
We are firmly convinced that the time has come for the international
community - and, in particular, for this Council - to condemn in no uncertain
terms the aggressor and give the victims the means to exercise their natural
right to self-defence, as enshrined in article 51 of the United Nations
Charter. The Bosnian Muslims, who with courage and dignity are facing up to
untold barbarism, are entitled to demand here and now that they be given the
means to ensure their self-defence.
We believe that logic, equity and the most basic justice call for an end
to the anachronistic denial to the victim of the indispensable means for
survival and the deterrence of aggression. The tragic circumstances of Bosnia
and Herzegovina and the peace process, which has now begun to unravel, make it
essential and urgent that, for the benefit of the Government of the Republic
of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the arms embargo imposed by resolution 713 (1993)
be lifted. It must be recalled that the embargo was imposed in circumstances
that were fundamentally different from those prevailing today, circumstances
that defy the world's conscience.
For these reasons Algeria has co-sponsored the draft resolution before
the Security Council, which was drafted by the non-aligned countries members
of the Council.
The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina indisputably involves the
question of the Security Council's credibility. The imperatives of justice
and the expectations of the international community and world-wide public
opinion, which follow with indignation the sorrowful events that become more
intense in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina with every passing day, call
for bold measures to be taken to respond to the demands of this crisis whose
nature is now quite clear to all.
S/PV.3247
95
(Mr. Hadid, Algeria)
Lifting the arms embargo for the benefit of the Government of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, controlling heavy arms, ending aggression, respecting human
rights, reaffirming and respecting the principle of the inadmissibility of the
acquisition of territories by force and preserving the sovereignty,
independence and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina - these are
the main requirements for a just solution in keeping with international law.
S/PV.3247
96
(Mr, Hadid, Algeria)
No intellectual exercise, however sophisticated, could justify failure to
act. Humanitarian missions are of course necessary, but in themselves they
are not enough to remove the responsibility from the Security Council of
ensuring, as it is supposed to do under the Charter of the United Nations, the
maintenance of international peace and security.
The Security Council, short of denying its mandate and relinquishing its
mission, cannot confine itself to the role of an accessory to humanitarian
organizations. As we see it, the opposite is what should be happening.
Not so long ago, the end of the cold war was welcomed as heralding the
advent of a new era full of promise for mankind. Is it conceivable, is it
moral, is it unavoidable, that this new era should in the final analysis turn
out to be the era of genocide that is tolerated, expansionism that is
accepted, and victims that are simply abandoned? Whether it be powerlessness
or the use of a double standard, or both, the Security Council's
responsibility vis-a-vis history is indeed engaged. Continuing indecision
would not only give recognition to an unacceptable injustice, but also
endanger international peace and security. In the final analysis, this would
mean going against the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United
Nations.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the
representative of Algeria for the kind words he addressed to me.
The next speaker is the representative of the Libyan Arab Jamahariya. I
invite him to take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr. OMAR (Libyan Arab Jamahiriya)(interpretation from Arabic): I
should like to congratulate you. Sir, on your presidency of the Security
Council during this month. I wish also to commend your predecessor, the
S/PV.3247
97
(Mr, Omar, Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya)
Ambassador of the Russian Federation, for his efforts during his presidency of
the Council last month.
Before I make my statement, I wish to express support for the statement
made by the Ambassador of Jordan on behalf of the Arab Group and that made by
the Ambassador of Indonesia on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. I should
like also to commend the non-aligned caucus in the Security Council for its
tireless efforts with regard to the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We noted with appreciation the letter (S/25782) dated 14 May 1993
addressed to the President of the Security Council. This letter reflects the
views and concerns of the non-aligned caucus regarding the situation in Bosnia
and Herzegovina. The call by the caucus for the holding of this meeting and
its initiative in submitting a draft resolution is a further element in these
sincere efforts.
The draft resolution in document S/25997, submitted by the non-aligned
caucus, is the result of the painful frustration and disappointment felt at
the inability to put an end to the tragedy of the people of Bosnia and
"Herzegovina; it has emerged from the feeling that everyone has abandoned that"
people's just cause.
This draft resolution is submitted in the framework of a situation of
hesitation and of the failure of various projects, plans and resolutions to
stop the continuing deterioration of the political and humanitarian situation
in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is submitted also in the context of the strong
doubts that have been expressed about the possibility of reaching a just
settlement that would preserve the life and dignity of that people and a State
that we all welcomed to the United Nations.
S/PV.3247
98
(Mr. Omar, Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya)
This draft resolution does not contain any extraneous elements. It does
not contradict the Charter of the United Nations. It reaffirms the
sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of the Republic
of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It calls for the immediate cessation of acts of
aggression against the territory of that State and for the removal of the
consequences of such aggression.
If our intentions are good, we cannot but agree with all that. We
welcomed the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a Member of the United
Nations. Does that Member not deserve our confirmation of its sovereignty?
Does it not deserve our recognition of its territorial integrity, its
political independence, its right to peace and security?
The draft resolution also calls for making available to that people all
the means necessary for defending itself - a natural right enshrined in
Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, and recognized by all norms
of law and religion.
The draft resolution calls for exempting the Government of the Republic
of Bosnia and Herzegovina from the arms embargo imposed on it by resolution
713 (1991), to enable it to defend itself. That is called for only to rectify
a wrong done to a defenceless people, making it the target of aggression by
the use of all kinds of weapons. The present situation of this people is like
that of a person who has been thrown into the water with his hands tied and
then told to be sure not to get wet. Resolution 713 (1991) deprived this
people of its right to self-defence.
We do not believe that lifting the arms embargo against the Government of
the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina will escalate the violence of the
S/PV.3247
99-100
(Mr, Omar, Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya)
situation, as some contend. This is a very strange argument made while the
massacres continue every day.
The lifting of the arms embargo and the adoption of military measures to
remove materiel are still options in the present circumstances to deal with
the crisis and provide a climate favourable to the adoption of the peace
plan. That is stated in the letter from the non-aligned States to the
Security Council dated 14 May 1993.
S/PV.3247
101
(Mr, Omar, Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya)
If the right of self-defence in this situation cannot be exercised, the
people of Bosnia and Herzegovina will be a victim of the total disregard of
international law and the resolutions of the Security Council. That people
should be the first to be able to act under Article 51 of the United Nations
Charter. It should be given priority. It should be listened to. It should
be supported and assisted in the exercise of its right of self-defence against
"massacres, ""ethnic cleansing"", the systematic rape of its women, the"
displacement of its children, the destruction of its places of worship and its
homes, and the transformation of the rest of its territory into one great
prison in which prisoners and refugees suffer from hunger and exposure.
This may be the last opportunity for the Security Council to regain the
initiative, to adopt whatever measures are necessary to preserve the integrity
of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and to enable it to establish and
maintain peace and security in that region while protecting its people in all
its religious and ethnic diversity. In this regard, I should like to recall
that, pursuant to Article 24 of the Charter, in carrying out its duties the
Security Council acts on behalf of the Members of the United Nations. This
means that the Security Council's actions should reflect the views of the
international community, not those of certain Powers. When the Security
Council fulfils its responsibilities, it should be fully aware of the
principles and objectives of the United Nations and pay the utmost deference
to legitimacy. It should not give in to certain interests and trends. If the
Security Council acts appropriately, it will be embarking upon the path
towards the establishment of a new international order and be distancing
itself from its policy of double standards.
S/PV.3247
102
(Mr. Omar, Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya)
If the Security Council is to be more than a debating society for
adopting ineffectual measures and accepting faits accomplis, it must take the
initiative. The issue of Bosnia and Herzegovina is a very important test, an
opportunity not to be wasted. We hope that the draft resolution before us
today will be adopted as a first step in a comprehensive plan to achieve a
just solution to this issue.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the
representative of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya for his kind words addressed to
me.
The next speaker is the representative of Bangladesh. I invite him to
take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr. KABIR (Bangladesh): Please allow me at the outset to join
previous speakers in extending to you. Sir, my delegation's heartiest
congratulations on your assumption of the office of the President of the
Council for the month of June. We are confident that, under your wise
leadership, the deliberations of the Council will lead to conclusions that are
decisive and address the core of the issue.
I also take this opportunity to convey our profound appreciation to your
predecessor, Ambassador Vorontsov of the Russian Federation, for his excellent
skills in guiding the work of the Council last month.
Even as we debate the issue today, the agonized cry of the helpless
people of Bosnia and Herzegovina continues unabated, touching the souls of all
witnessing this incredible saga of pain. Needless to say, we have deliberated
on this tragic issue many a time before, both in the Assembly and the Council,
and adopted as many resolutions - but unfortunately to no avail. Nothing
seems to deter Serbia in its planned pogrom against the Bosnian people, with
S/PV.3247
103
(Mr, Kabir, Bangladesh)
Muslims in Bosnia as a special target, or quench its insatiable desire to
acquire Bosnian land and property and in the process cause senseless suffering
to millions of innocent men, women and children across its territory. It
seems our resolve or determination were not firm enough to draw the curtain on
this heart-rending tragedy. It does not reflect a becoming picture of us
Members of the United Nations as we watch helplessly the slow death in
excruciating pain of a fellow Member.
We have time and again considered the consequences arising out of the
lifting of the arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina, though to many of us it
"was clear that Serbia's repugnant policy of ""ethnic cleansing"" was aimed at"
the liquidation of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a nation. To some, however, a
flame of hope still burned for an end to the human carnage and culmination in
a peaceful solution.
We have now reached a stage where it is obvious to all that Serbia's
intention is wantonly to persist in its policy of territorial acquisition
"until the conquest - ’’conquest"", a word we though was left behind - of Bosnia"
and Herzegovina is completed. It was already felt by the World Conference on
Human Rights held recently in Vienna, which decided to appeal to the Council
"to take the necessary measures to end what it termed ""genocide"" in Bosnia and"
Herzegovina. The Conference therefore declared that now is the time for the
1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide to
be implemented to the letter. At the same Conference, our Foreign Minister
declared that:
"""Such violations go on because we apply different standards to different"
situations. In our opinion, if human rights values are to become
universal and self-sustaining, such a dual attitude or selectivity on our
"part must go""."
S/PV.3247
104-105
(Mr. Kabir, Bangladesh)
Let us not fail here to see what we had already observed and accepted in
Vienna. Let us make all-out efforts to save a fellow Member nation from total
extinction. Let us decide now to adopt immediate measures to lift the arms
embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina to enable the Government and people to
exercise their inherent right of self-defence. All of our earlier resolutions
were contemptuously ignored by the Serbians in their march towards
"expansionism and ""ethnic cleansing"". Our earlier resolution 713 (1991) on the"
arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia was meant to deter the aggressor.
We now see it has failed to do so. While the Serbians continued to be swamped
by arms and ammunition, the effect of the embargo was disastrous to and
bitterly felt by the Bosnians alone. They became helpless targets of
elimination while we and the world sat and watched as they slowly became
"prisoners in their own land in so-called ""safe areas"". Therefore, if we do"
not, even now, lift the arms embargo to enable them to fight for their
survival, we shall see sadly before our eyes the demise of the Bosnians as a
people and the end of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a sovereign nation.
S/PV.3247
106
(Mr, Kabir, Bangladesh)
Our conscience as fellow humans and as Members of the United Nations
dictates that we support the resolution to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia and
Herzegovina. Inertia or inaction now would only deal a cruel and deadly blow
"to the international law and legitimacy; all our faith in this great"
institution - the United Nations, which was based on the concept of
"""collective security” - would suffer a fatal setback, and the soul of the"
United Nations, if not the United Nations itself, would wither away with the
painful end of this tragic drama as we see it.
We, the peoples, cannot be seen to be parochial and selective in reading
the Charter. All the provisions of Chapter VII of the Charter are as sacred
as those of any other Chapter.
Naive as it may seem, we cannot just watch a fellow human being on his
last breath, dying slowly, while critical oxygen is being withheld, the more
so when we fellow human beings around seem not yet to have succeeded,
regrettably, in our collective efforts to reverse his imminent cardiac arrest.
My Government therefore firmly believes the present debate in the Council
will culminate in the unanimous adoption of draft resolution S/25997, which
alone can not only save the Bosnians from elimination, but also deter the
aggressors and persuade them to seek a negotiated political settlement.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the
representative of Bangladesh for his kind words addressed to me.
The next speaker is the representative of Costa Rica. I invite him to
take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr. TATTENBACH (Costa Rica) (interpretation from Spanish): I begin,
Sir, by warmly congratulating you on having assumed the presidency of the
Council, and by greeting you and the other members of the Council. I wish
S/PV.3247
107
(Mr. Tattenbach, Costa Rica)
also to tell you how pleased I am at the way in which you are directing the
affairs of the Council, which holds so much responsibility for the future of
mankind. I am sincerely grateful for the opportunity to address the Council.
About a year ago I had the honour to express in the General Assembly the
anguish and indignation caused in my country by the serious violations of the
Charter and international humanitarian law that were occurring daily in Bosnia
and Herzegovina. We could not have imagined then that a year later the
situation would still be the same or, if that were possible, even considerably
worse.
One must therefore conclude that notwithstanding its many good
intentions, the international community has not managed to find a way to
remedy that dreadful situation. As a result it is necessary to consider new
options, and it is to them that I direct my remarks.
A year ago we warned that an independent, sovereign State, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, formally recognized by the United Nations, should not be deprived
of access to what it needed to exercise its inherent right to self-defence,
whether individual or collective, as guaranteed by Article 51 of the Charter.
Today, Costa Rica, which has no standing army and which rejects the use of
arms as a way to resolve disputes, believes that even worse than the rumble of
the cannons of an aggressor is having to succumb, defenceless, to the
aggressor because one's hands are tied as a result of an unjust international
agreement.
My delegation therefore urges the Security Council as strongly as we can
to lift the embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina's acquiring arms to defend
itself, so that we may present as serious a situation as the virtually total
dismemberment of that State and the continuation of the monstrous violations
of humanitarian law.
S/PV.3247
108
(Mr, Tattenbach, Costa Rica)
We believe that in this case one cannot ignore the Charter and one of its
fundamental Articles by virtually denying a State the right to survival and
subjecting it to a slow, cruel death. Ethical and legal duty both oblige us
to keep Article 51 of the Charter intact. We have all solemnly committed
ourselves to that.
We therefore today shoulder our responsibility, however many other
considerations may be involved, and declare ourselves, just as we did recently
at the World Conference on Human Rights, clearly in favour of the sacred right
to self-defence by all necessary means.
The CHAIRMAN (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the
representative of Costa Rica for the kind words he addressed to me.
The next speaker is the representative of Slovenia. I invite him to take
a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr. KOVACIC (Slovenia): Let me begin by expressing our appreciation
at seeing you in the Chair, Sir. We are convinced that your ability and skill
will contribute significantly to the success of the Security Council. Let us
also express our appreciation to your predecessor. Ambassador Vorontsov of the
Russian Federation, who presided over the proceedings of the Security Council
in May.
Later today the Security Council will take action on an important
proposal submitted by the group of Non-Aligned members of the Council. The
proposal concerns the situation arising from the armed conflict in Bosnia and
Herzegovina and calls for immediate action to preserve the territorial
integrity and political independence of that country - a Member State of the
United Nations - and to put an end to the genocide perpetrated against the
Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
S/PV.3247
109-110
(Mr. Kovacic, Slovenia)
The Security Council has devoted much of its time to the armed conflict
in Bosnia and Herzegovina in recent months. The resolutions adopted thus far
have not yielded the expected results, and have in some cases avoided the
crucial issues. Now there may be one of the last opportunities for a change.
Slovenia is not a member of the Security Council and has not participated
in the preparation of the draft before the Council. However, we wish to state
certain basic principles clearly and unequivocally.
First, the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina is neither a civil war nor an
ethnic conflict. It is a war of aggression perpetrated from outside Bosnia
and Herzegovina, and it is a war for territory. Every State has the inherent
right, in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, to
legitimate self-defence. This right should not be denied to Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
Secondly, genocide must be stopped, and deeds, not mere words, are
necessary. This is the most elementary commandment of any morality.
Thirdly, the Security Coucil must find a way to preserve the existence of
a United Nations Member State, or the whole system of collective security will
be put in jeopardy.
Fourthly, preservation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is a vital requirement
for peace and political stability in south-eastern Europe and, indeed in
Europe as a whole.
There comes a time when the responsibility of the Security Council
requires the most serious reflection and decision. This is such a time.
S/PV.3247
111
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the
representative of Slovenia for the kind words he addressed to me.
The next speaker is the representative of Ukraine. I invite him to take
a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr. KHANDOGY (Ukraine) (interpretation from Russian): Let me begin
by congratulating you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the
Security Council for the month of June. We are certain that under your
experienced guidance the Council will find the best path to a solution of the
item on its agenda today.
My delegation wishes also to express its appreciation to the Permanent
Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations,
Ambassador Yuliy Vorontsov, for the excellent way in which he presided over
the work of the Security Council in May.
There is no need to emphasize the importance of the subject before the
Council today or the heavy responsibilty the Council bears as it takes up this
item. The continuing tragedy in Bosnia and Herzegovina claims new victims
daily. It brings more suffering and more destruction. That once-flourishing
land is now devastated. We constantly witness terrible bloodshed.
It is clear that there is no alternative to a peaceful negotiated
settlement. As it has in the past, the delegation of Ukraine supports that
"approach; we think it can bring peace to Bosnia and Herzegovina."
We share the view that a settlement of the conflict in Bosnia and
Herzegovina should be based on the following principles: an immediate
"cessation of hostilities; withdrawal of forces; an end to ""ethnic cleansing"";"
S/PV.3247
112
(Mr. Khandogv, Ukraine)
"recognition of the right of all Bosnian refugees to return home; and"
preservation of the territorial integrity and independence of Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
In that connection we appeal to members of the Council to display wisdom
as they consider and act upon the draft resolution before them. Any careless
step, however advisable it might seem now, could lead to more bloodshed and to
an escalation of the conflict. That would only increase the suffering of the
civilian population and make it even more difficult to find a way out of this
impasse. That in turn would pose a greater threat to the security of United
Nations peace-keepers and would make it even harder to protect the civilian
population and deliver humanitarian aid. It would add to the losses currently
being experienced.
Ukraine has contingents stationed in the region of Sarajevo, one of the
most dangerous in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Lifting the arms embargo imposed by
resolution 713 (1991) in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina would make the
position of the Ukrainian troops there even more difficult and uncertain. We
have already sustained considerable losses and many casualties.
As it considers this measure, the Security Council should also consider
additional effective measures to protect United Nations peace-keepers in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. We are concerned at the real possibility that
hostilities would be intensified if the arms embargo were lifted in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. Ukraine favours strict compliance with the resolutions already
adopted by the Security Council. We also think it might be an important step
to put under effective United Nations control all heavy weapons now at the
disposal of the Bosnian Serbs. In our opinion, that would lower the level of
S/PV.3247
113
(Mr. Khandogy, Ukraine)
military confrontation in the region and would remove from our agenda the
question of lifting the embargo in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In conclusion, we reiterate that Ukraine considers that the only way to
resolve the conflict is to pursue the peace process. We are convinced that
permitting more weapons into Bosnia and Herzegovina will not bring peace. It
will only bring more suffering and more victims.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): I thank the
representative of Ukraine for the kind words he addressed to me.
I wish to inform members of the Council that the following have become
sponsors of draft resolution S/25997: Albania, Indonesia, the Islamic
Republic of Iran, Jordan, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Tunisia and the United
Arab Emirates.
The representative of Morocco wishes to make a statement in exercise of
the right of reply, and I call upon him now.
Mr. SNOUSSI (Morocco) (interpretation from French): In his
statement, Mr. Djokic referred to the sponsors of draft resolution S/25997,
and claimed that they were not committed to a peaceful settlement of the
"conflict but rather to advancing ""their own limited political objectives. In"
view of that totally unwarranted, erroneous and unfounded assertion, and
without wishing to enter ii.to polemics, I am obliged to address some questions
to Ambassador Djokic.
Mr. Djokic: Are you serious when you speak of a peaceful solution? Do
you know the meaning of a peaceful solution? Can there be no peaceful
solution other than that envisaged by the Bosnian Serbs? Can there be no
peaceful solution other than one founded on what has been inflicted upon the
S/PV.3247
114-115
(Mr, Snoussi, Morocco)
"disarmed Bosnians in terms of ""ethnic cleansing"", torture and camps? How can"
a peaceful solution be imposed on those who do not desire peace and who do not
accept peace, but who only strive for hegemony, aggrandizement and the
subjugation of others? What kind of peace are you talking about?
Let me remind you, Mr. Djokic, that the authors of the draft resolution,
whom you dismiss so lightly, are so committed to peace that they unreservedly
backed the Vance-Owen Peace Plan to the very end. In fact, they persuaded the
representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina, despite their reluctance, to accept
it.
"Mr. Djokic spoke of attaining ""limited political objectives"". If you,"
"Mr. Djokic, take a ""limited objective"" to mean saving a people that is daily"
being exterminated and that has the legitimate right to self-defence and to
existence, then that is the objective pursued by the non-aligned countries and
all other countries that want to remind the international community that it
must be careful in dealing with people who sow such confusion.
The PRESIDENT (ii'terpretation from Spanish): It is my understanding
that the Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft resolution
before it. If I hear no objection, I shall take it that that is the case.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
Before putting the draft resolution to the vote, I shall call on those
members of the Council who wish to make statements before the voting.
S/PV.3247
116
Mr. OLHAYE (Djibouti): The draft resolution before the Council is
the culmination of a series of failed policies, decisions not fully
implemented or decisions ostensibly deferred indefinitely when implementing
them could have made a significant difference to the plight of a million
defenceless Bosnians. And now Bosnia's future political structure is in the
process of being seriously undermined as the parties are set to
institutionalize their spoils of war.
Saving Bosnia requires a sea change in the attitudes and conceptions of a
goodly number of countries on this Council. Few areas, particularly Muslim
ones, are being spared. Pitched battles have raged over the last twelve
"months; cities and towns have gone up in flames, killing tens of thousands and"
"condemning the rest to the reprehensible practice of ""ethnic cleansing"", which"
has driven these the large majority of destitute people to severely
overcrowded, insecure and inhumane destinations, or to wander hopelessly in
other countries in Europe as refugees.
Famous historical and religious landmarks have been intentionally
"targeted and destroyed; this happened amongst people who had lived together"
for centuries. The sense of frustration and outrage inherent in Bosnia's
tragedy is perhaps best epitomized by the woman who, together with hundreds of
Muslim civilians evicted from their homes, was marched out of Mostar, down a
mountain to a detention camp last month, and then broke down and sobbed:
"""We are all Muslims; we are prisoners. This is a crime, a shame, and"
"this is Europe!"""
It looks more and more as if it is not only the Bosnians who have been
"herded and shunted into so-called ""safe areas"" by the continuing Serbian"
aggression, but the entire United Nations too. Having furiously and lavishly
S/PV.3247
117
(Mr. Olhave, Djibouti)
painted the diplomatic and international landscape for the past year and a
half with every imaginable colour and pattern while ignoring pleas to stop
painting and come outside and do something, we now come to the realization
that we have in effect painted ourselves into a corner.
It is tiresomely redundant for us to reel off yet again the litany of
bold resolutions, pronouncements and statements that have emanated from the
United Nations over this period, each of them pregnant with the implied threat
of real United Nations intervention to halt the aggression. More and more it
seems that the only party that realized it was all perhaps a bluff was the one
it was most intended to fool: the Serbs.
"The last major resolution we adopted, the ""safe areas” resolution, was"
replete with such bold assertions as adherence to the Vance-Owen plan as the
"basis for peace; the territorial integrity of Bosnia; the reversal of gains"
"achieved through aggression; the condemnation of human rights violations; the"
"evil of ""ethnic cleansing""; support for a war crimes Tribunal to bring the"
violators of human rights to justice, and so on and so on. There was also the
open threat of stronger action if results were not forthcoming. We have all
come to realize - the Serbs sooner than anyone - that the implied threat had
all along been a veiled bluff: nothing of direct significance was to be done
to halt the Serbs.
"Even more worrisome, probably nothing is to be done to protect the ""safe"
"areas"". This places the Bosnians in very grave danger: they obviously can no"
longer rely on the actions jr words of the United Nations. Even the
ubiquitous Lord Owen has begun to abandon his own ship.
Serb aggression, however, continues unabated, while the ever widening
arms imbalance, coupled with the arms embargo, militates heavily against the
S/PV.3247
118
(Mr. Olhaye, Djibouti)
outgunned Muslims. This community is in a dire dilemma, and the available
choices, if any, are most unappealing. The international community’s
paralysis of will has now hastened a carve-up of Bosnia along communal lines
that will face the almost two million Muslims with the prospect of being
forced out into an economically bankrupt mini-State. While the details are
still sketchy, the public pronouncements of Serb and Croat nationalists leave
us with no doubt that their devious strategy would force the Muslims, who
comprised 44 per cent of the pre-war population with 34 per cent of the land,
onto 10 per cent of its land.
What is happening in Geneva is therefore a direct challenge to the
authority of President Alija Izetbegovic, the sole remaining symbol of
legitimate leadership in Sarajevo. His crime is his insistence that Bosnia
remain a single, multiracial, multicultural State. The Serb and Croat
nationalists, in full view >f their chief patrons, are carrying out a shabby
and indecent plot to force the beleaguered and hapless Muslims into accepting
the division of Bosnia.
But this Council has consistently reaffirmed the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina: are we now to bend before
the endorsement of any makeshift meeting that does not truly represent the
constituent peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina? In this respect, we draw some
solace from the latest declaration of the European Council, issued in
Copenhagen on 22 June, which, inter alia, encouraged the Co-Chairmen to pursue
their efforts to promote a fair and viable settlement acceptable to all three
constituent peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The European Council stated
that it would not accept a territorial solution dictated by the Serbs and
Croats at the expense of ths Bosnian Muslims. The declaration also reaffirmed
S/PV.3247
119
(Mr, Olhave, Djibouti)
that a negotiated settlement must be based on the principles of the London
Conference reflected in the Vance-Owen peace plan, and on the inadmissibility
of the acquisition of territory by force.
The bottom line is that the Bosnians face certain extinction. By default
the Bosnians must protect themselves if they are to survive, for no one else
is prepared to step in. That is the stark truth. Obviously, if the Bosnians
are to defend and protect themselves, they must have the means to do so, and
that requires a lifting of the arms embargo imposed by the Security Council in
its resolution 713 (1991) as it applies to the Government of Bosnia,
consistent with Article 51 of the Charter. We wholeheartedly support this
initiative as the best measure to achieve peace, given the current realities
of the situation unfolding in Bosnia. Whatever any of the players decides,
accepts or negotiates to resolve this crisis, the chances of a continuation or
resumption of hostilities will be lessened only if that continuation or
resumption comes at a heavy price. But no one is ready to exact that price.
Ironically, the most readily acceptable option has become to exact more and
more from the helpless victims and pressure them to make concession after
concession.
My delegation has lost all patience with the standard, often repeated and
self-justifying cries for the arms status quo. We do not believe it will lead
to the spread of a general Balkan war if a key victim is seen to defend
itself. This must surely be the factor that would give pause to the
aggressors. If, as we are told, the Serbs have completed their territorial
aggression, then to put the Bosnians into a position to defend themselves
should have only a positive bearing on the situation by putting a price on a
resumption of hostilities.
S/PV.3247
120
(Mr, Olhaye, Djibouti)
Though arming the Bosnians might not enable tnem to reverse the results
of the aggression, at this point that is not the issue: the issue is their
survival, and who is to take responsibility for it. If the arming of Bosnia
poses a threat to United Nations forces, then these forces should either be
"better armed and reinforced to protect themselves, removed to ""safe areas"" or"
removed completely out of danger. The Bosnians can no longer afford a United
Nations Protection Force that, despite its formidable, heroic and humanitarian
engagement, cannot even rattle its sabre in the face of the most gruesome
atrocities - and this for lack of a mandate: in other words, for lack of
political commitment on the part of the international community.
Finally, to claim that arming the Bosnians would halt the flow of
humanitarian aid is a weak irgument, considering the feebleness of such aid at
present. The time has come, in our view, for candour and transparency, and
for a real re-evaluation of our policy towards this unprecedented tragedy.
S/PV.3247
121
(Mr, Olhaye, Djibouti)
We all know what has happened in Bosnia and what is still taking place
there. Those who oppose lifting the arms embargo as it applies to the
Bosnians will have to not only repeat their litany of the dangers this move
poses but also state flatly what they propose to do to ensure the safety and
survival of the Bosnians, halt Serb aggression and end hostilities in the
country. We suspect they are, in fact, prepared to do very little, which is
why Bosnia must fully, within its rights as a sovereign Member of the United
Nations, seek to protect itself.
My delegation fully supports this draft resolution to exempt the Bosnian
Government from the arms embargo imposed on the former Yugoslavia by our
resolution 713 (1991).
Mr, ARRIA (Venezuela) (interpretation from Spanish): Article 51 of
the Charter must be accepted and interpreted by all members of the Security
Council without any form of discrimination. Just as yesterday we recognized
as a fact one of our members* right to self-defence, we must do everything
possible to see that, at the very least, that same right is not denied the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Today we are debating the possible conseguences of adopting the draft
resolution that we, the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement that are members
of the Security Council - Cape Verde, Djibouti, Morocco, Pakistan and
Venezuela - have brought before the Council, along with the reasons that form
its basis and justification.
I shall now take the liberty of summing up the main considerations that,
throughout our consultations and discussions, have been put forward by
represenatives in the Council who oppose the adoption of this draft
resolution. I shall also take the liberty of offering some thoughts on these
objections and concerns.
S/PV.3247
122
(Mr. Arria, Venezuela)
The main objections to the draft resolution that we have heard are the
followings first, it would increase the level of violence and the conflict
"would spread and intensify; secondly, there would be more war, not less - all"
"the parties would acquire more sophisticated arms; thirdly, the negotiating"
"process in Geneva would be put in jeopardy; fourthly, it would mean the end of"
"the safe areas; fifthly, it would speed up the Serbian offensive against what"
"remains of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which would be totally conquered; sixthly,"
"humanitarian aid would be jeopardized; seventh, the personnel of the United"
"Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) would be withdrawn; and, eighth, it would"
be an admission that the Security Council had suffered a defeat in the face of
this conflict.
Before I take up each of these objections, allow me to remind the Council
that the arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia, which was decreed before
the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was internationally recognized, has
affected only that Republic. It is generally accepted that the Bosnian Serbs
and Bosnian Croats received and continue to receive all the military support
and equipment of other countries in the region and that the Security Council
has still not managed to stop that violation of the embargo.
Now I shall comment on the objections.
It would increase violnnce. About 200,000 people have already died.
More than 2 million people have been displaced from their homes. Twenty
thousand women have been raped. The International Court of Justice and the
World Conference on Human Rights have indicated that Bosnia and Herzegovina is
"a victim of genocide and ""ethnic cleansing"", among other unspeakable crimes."
For this Council, then, what does it mean to say that violence would increase
and spread?
S/PV.3247
123
(Mr. Arria, Venezuela)
Obviously, an armed people would have a greater ability to defend
itself - which does not mean that violence would necessarily increase. To
date, the Serbs have found it very easy to trample and vandalize the Bosnian
Muslims. When the latter are able to defend themselves, circumstances may
deter the Serbs and, above all, place limits on their impunity.
More war? The international community’s inconsistent attitude in the
adoption of measures to stop aggression has given free rein to the escalation
of the conflict, which has meant a massacre of mainly the Bosnian Muslim
people. That is a reality.
The negotiating process in Geneva will be affected. Frankly, in Geneva
what remained of the the Vance-Owen Plan has been replaced by the
Karadzic-Milosevic-Tudjman-Bovan agreement. Why should the United Nations
worry about affecting a process in which those who took a territory by force
seek the legitimacy undoubtedly conferred on them by the presence - and not a
passive presence - of Lord Owen and Mr. Stoltenberg at the site of the talks:
the Palais des Nations in Geneva. I cannot understand how Lord Owen can
declare that,
(spoke in English)
"""We have to stop this nonsense of decisions being taken by the Bosnian"
"Government that are not discussed by the Government; we could do to"
Izetbegovic what Karadzic and Bovan do, which is to refer to him as the
Muslim party.”
(spoke in Spanish)
Even more difficult to understand is that the division of an already
well-battered Government could be provoked in order to eliminate any obstacles
in the way of the partition agreement being hatched in Geneva.
S/PV.3247
124
(Mr, Arria, Venezuela)
The United Nations cannot, must not, lend its name - which is that of all
our nations, small, medium-sized and large - to the legitimization of the
final ravaging of that Republic. The old colonial philosophy that says,
(spoke in English)
"""There are times when considerations of abstract justice must give way to"
"those of administrative expediency"""
(spoke in Spanish)
must not be realized.
It would be the end of the safe areas. The whole world knows what those
areas consist of and what they mean. To continue calling them by that name
threatens to destroy what little credibility the Council has left in this
conflict. For the past three months, Srebrenica, the first safe area, has
been forcibly deprived of its services of potable water, electricity and
medical care. Epidemics are devouring thousands of children caught between
the cruelty of their Serbian jailers and our own inability to defend them.
In Gorazde, another safe area, no sooner do we manage to get a few trucks
in and the area is once again under siege. Sarajevo, Tuzla, Bilhac and Zepa
constitute the rest of the chain of atrocities. Those zones are definitely
free and safe for committing all kinds of crimes and attacks. Those of us who
have been there know this very well.
The Serbian offensive would be speeded up. This is very probably true,
unless the international conmunity decides to carry out the necessary
compensatory actions to neutralize the heavy armaments which have been
allowing the Serbs to act with all impunity. If this is not done, there is no
doubt that a disarmed Government will in the end be worn down and conquered.
"""What would the international community do then?"" asked one of our"
Security Council colleagues in one of our meetings. There can only be one
S/PV.3247
125
(Mr, Arria, Venezuela)
answer:	do everything necessary so that this does not come about, because if
it did, Europe would never be the same, neither for itself nor for the rest of
the world. In this regard. President Gonzalez of Spain stated in Copenhagen,
"""If the international community is unable to resolve the problem by the"
means available to it and if it does not want to undertake a massive
intervention in Yugoslavia, as seems obvious, the Bosnians' right to
"self-defence begins to emerge."""
"President Mitterrand of France said, ""It is intolerable that the Muslims"
"cannot defend themselves."" And he reminded his colleagues in the European"
Community that the United Nations had decided to defend their safe areas and
that the Secretary-General was still begging the Governments of the third
world to provide 7,500 soldiers. President Mitterrand said,
"""If we were talking about the security of our own States, it would take"
"us two hours, not weeks, to take that decision."""
In conclusion he said,
"""If we cannot defend the safe areas, it will be impossible to tell the"
"Bosnian Muslims that they will not be allowed to defend themselves."""
To these statements of such distinguished statesmen can be added that of
the Head of Government of Germany, Mr. Helmut Kohl:
"""The international community cannot be allowed to abandon the Bosnian"
Muslims. Lifting the arms embargo is a necessity and a moral duty,
"because it means helping the weakest."""
And finally, the statement of Baroness Thatcher:
"""It is intolerable to prevent people from defending themselves, unless"
"one is willing to defexid them oneself."""
S/PV.3247
126
(Mr, Arria, Venezuela)
It is further objected that humanitarian assistance would be compromised.
That would definitely be the case - although humanitarian assistance by
air, transported by the United States, has reached places where UNPROFOR
troops have never been able to go. In that sense, it is important to
emphasize that humanitarian assistance was conceived as a mean of helping a
people to survive while steps were taken to put an end to the conflict - but
not to take the place of a more purposeful and significant effort. The point
is not just to halt the outflow of refugees or to attend to the needs of a
devastated people. Humanitarian assistance, as the Coordinator of Red Cross
Operations - in the former Yugoslavia - described it,
"""has been used by the humanitarian organizations to fill a political"
vacuum created by the international community. We have been asked to
throw flour at political problems. Convoys protected by the United
Nations are subjected to all kinds of humiliation, creating the illusion
of helping -- and in fact they are helping, but they are far from
"resolving the problem."""
He added:
"""The humanitarian organizations cannot take the place of political"
decisions. Governments should stop using humanitarian organizations for
"their own purposes."""
In that respect, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General,
Mr. Stoltenberg, recently informed the Security Council that the climate of
insecurity in which the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), UNPROFOR and other humanitarian agencies operate has grown
so acute that these operations cannot continue very much longer, given the
intensification of the conflict. This information indicates that the
humanitarian assistance is already extremely compromised.
S/PV.3247
127
(Mr. Arria, Venezuela)
The noble contingents of UNPROFOR have rendered extraordinary service,
but, notwithstanding the fact that their mandate would permit it, they are not
equipped or prepared to defend themselves appropriately. As my colleague the
Ambassador of Djibouti has rightly pointed out, the option to be considered -
calmly and in keeping with the gravity of the question - would be either to
give a really effective mandate to these troops or to withdraw them. What
cannot be envisaged is for them to protect only the humanitarian convoys and
not the people.
The last of the objections is that this would recognize the defeat of the
United Nations. The fact is that the Security Council inherited a situation
that had very seriously deteriorated. Almost two years ago, at the beginning
of the conflict, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg,
"Mr. Jacques Poos, stated: ""This is the hour of Europe, not the hour of the"
"Americans"". At that time, the effort was being made - in fact, an"
unsuccessful effort - to deal with the conflict regionally. Almost
40 resolutions later - and after the Security Council has supported the London
Conference, the peace plans of Lord Carrington and of Vance and Owen, and the
Washington plan of action - no one here today can deny that the aggressors
have been progressively defeating this illustrious body that represents the
international community.
It must be recognized, however, that we have managed to save thousands of
lives through humanitarian assistance, but it is no less true that many more
thousands of lives have been lost at a time when the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina has all but disappeared. Now the new plan has as its protagonists
the chief aggressors against that Republic, and the international community
continues striving assiduously, at any price, to bring about an agreement that
would have to be imposed upon the victims.
S/PV.3247
128
(Mr, Arria, Venezuela)
The Security Council is not a debating society or a future-oriented think
tank. For that reason, to speculate about and anticipate the consequences of
the implementation of this resolution is not the proper business of the
Council. In fact, what is its business - and indeed its obligation - is to
see to it that the Charter of the United Nations is enforced.
In 1938, the Czechoslovak leader, Edvard Benes, was also described as
intransigent. The prestigious Times of London went so far as to publish an
editorial in which it pointed out that
"""The Czechoslovak Government should consider making its country more"
homogeneous, ceding the Sudetans to Germany - the neighbouring country
"with which they are united by race""."
This historical backdrop - actually very recent - has now sowed many
dangerous seeds in the degenerating conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. On the one hand, President Aliza Izetbegovic is described - just
as Benes was - as intransigent, and Bosnia and Herzegovina is being compelled
to cede to its Croat and Serb neighbours 90 per cent of its territory. What
will be left will be perfectly homogeneous areas, within the spirit of the
apartheid so often condemened by this Organization, which counts among its
main achievements its struggle against apartheid.
Obviously, President Izetbegovic feels the same national passion as
President Benes felt. His country is being dismembered, and he is on the way
to losing it entirely. He cannot be less than intransigent.
It was not enough for Hitler to do away with Benes and with
"Czechoslovakia. The offer of ""land for peace"" was not enough for him. Nor"
will it be enough for the conquerors of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which, after
exterminating the Muslims of that Republic, and having understood that crime
pays, are now extending their actions to the rest of the area.
S/PV.3247
129
(Mr, Arria, Venezuela)
For two years the illusion of a diplomacy of principles took us from the
London Conference with Lord Carrington, to the peace plan of Cyrus Vance and
Lord Owen, and now to Geneva with Stoltenberg. All these illustrious
diplomats have been effectively replaced as peace negotiators by Messrs.
Milosevic, Tudjman, Karadzic and Boban.
No country or group of countries has the right to instruct a State, no
matter how small or defenceless, on what it must or must not do. Not to come
to the defence of and protect a State victim of genocide and ethnic cleansing
is, as the International Court of Justice has pointed out, without any doubt a
most alarming development. To do all that one can possibly do to prevent a
people from exercising its right to defend itself in order to survive means to
shoulder moral and political responsibilities of extraordinary significance.
It is one thing to decide not to help a State that bases its preservation on
"the principle of collective security; it is another thing entirely to deny it"
its natural right to self-defence, in the face of the obvious decision not to
implement that principle. Those who today would make that decision, through
their vote, shoulder the corresponding responsibility before the world.
The draft resolution that we are discussing today is above all a
declaration of moral and political principles. We trust that the Security
Council will vote in favour of the draft resolution, because defending the
rights of States can never be conceived of as a minority position.
At the recent World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, a group of
delegations - including my own - upheld the concept of the universality of
human rights. Therefore, I cannot imagine that the very same countries would
not today agree with the universality of the inalienable rights of States to
self-defence.
S/PV.3247
130
(Mr. Arria, Venezuela)
In Geneva negotiations took place first with the Croatian side and then
with the Serbian side, but, strangely, when it came to negotiating with the
Muslim side of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it was agreed to bring
in seven members of the presidency of that Republic: three Croatians, three
Serbs and one Muslim. But unfortunately for its promoters, this Muslim, who
was entrusted with subscribing to the rules for the partition of his country,
is now being sought by the Austrian police for the crime of fraud against the
poor Muslim refugees.
President Izetbegovic, incredibly, has been pushed aside for his
"""hotheadedness"" in insisting that the ""peace plan"" promoted by the United"
Nations and the European Community - the Vance-Owen plan - be implemented.
S/PV.3247
131
(Mr, Arria, Venezuela)
Why has this happened? What has President Izetbegovic done, he who is
recognized by the entire international community as the legitimate President
of his country and until recently the valid interlocutor of the negotiators at
the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia? Quite simply.
President Izetbegovic - like Benes, like Churchilx, like De Gaulle, like the
valient people of Leningrad - did not agree to surrender, not even under the
worst possible conditions. Mr. Izetbegovic reminds me of the 1938 message of
"the great intransigent Sir Winston Churchill: ""Those who seek to prevent war"
"without honour will end up suffering dishonour and war""."
To conclude, I deem it appropriate to recall today that the European
Community took the initiative of recognizing the independence and territorial
integrity of the Republic cf Bosnia and Herzegovina and that subsequently this
lofty body, the Security Council, after an exhaustive and painstaking
consideration, recommended to the General Assembly its admission to membership
of this Organization. Almost two years have passed since those events. That
recognition was not given lightly. It seems incredible that barely two years
after Bosnia and Herzegovina was admitted as a Member State, the Security
Council can remain passive before the imminent partition of that Republic
"through territorial conquest by use of force and ""ethnic cleansing""."
The Security Council must be consistent and shoulder the responsibility
it assumed in recommending the admission of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina to membership of the United Nations end not keep that State from
the means necessary to safeguard its own existence, as provided for in the
resolution on which we shall vote shortly. To de otherwise would be to admit
an inconsistency of the most, extreme gravity.
S/PV.3247
132
Sir David HANNAY (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland):	The British Government has, from the very beginning of the crisis
in the former Yugoslavia, been at the forefront of international attempts to
find solutions. We have spared no effort to achieve a negotiated peace, to
bring help to the victims, to check the rampant abuse of human rights and to
punish those responsible for carrying out or assisting in aggressive action in
Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Croatia through the most Draconian set of
economic sanctions ever imposed by the United Nations. In these endeavours we
have not been sparing of men, money and political support, principally through
the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia. Substantial British
military forces in the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) have saved
the lives of many thousands of Bosnians of all three communities. Many
British civilian helpers have participated in the huge international relief
effort. The financial contributions of Britain and its European Community
partners to all these efforts have far exceeded those of any other country or
group of countries.
We regret that a political settlement has not yet been achieved. But the
United Nations cannot simply impose a political solution. The only way to
enforce peace in that way would be the despatch of a massive army to be
deployed in Bosnia for an indefinite period. No Government has seriously
suggested that. The present situation is deeply worrying, but in the view of
my Government it should not be a cause for despair nor should it be seen as a
reason for adopting what we regard as a solution of despair. That is how we
see the proposal to lift the arms embargo.
There are a number of reasons why we believe that such a decision would,
in practice, fail to help the people it is designed to assist, the Bosnian
Muslims, and would more probably result in a deterioration of the situation
S/PV.3247
133
(Sir David Hannay, United Kingdom)
and a collapse of the international and above all the United Nations efforts
to solve the crisis. For one thing, it would clearly result in an increase in
the fighting, all the more so because, given Bosnia's geographical situation,
it is simply not credible to believe that a relaxation of the arms embargo
would result in the arms reaching only the Bosnian Government forces. It is
already the case that a substantial proportion of the arms clandestinely
destined for Bosnia fall into other hands. Moreover, a decision to lift the
arms embargo would provide a probably irresistible temptation to the Bosnian
Serbs and Bosnian Croats to intensify their military efforts and to ensure
that, by the time any substantial delivery of weapons was made, the military
threat posed to them by the Bosnian Government forces had been neutralized.
In addition to these drawbacks, we do not see how the United Nations
current efforts in Bosnia and Herzegovina could be sustained following a
decision to lift the arms embargo and the inevitable intensification of the
"fighting. That is, we understand, the view of the Secretary-General; it is"
"the view of the Co-Chairmen of the International Conference; it is the view of"
"the commander of UNPROFOR; and it is the view of the United Nations High"
Commissioner for Refugees. The work of UNPROFOR, which has already saved
thousands of lives and is essential to the survival of so many in Bosnia and
"Herzegovina, would be fatally prejudiced; the devoted efforts of the"
international relief agencies under the leadership of UNHCR would be similarly
"undermined; and the peace process in Geneva would be set back if not"
destroyed. Above all, the adoption of this draft resolution would be seen as
a signal that the United Nations was turning its back on Bosnia and leaving
its inhabitants to fight it out, come what may.
S/PV.3247
134
(Sir David Hannav, United Kingdom)
These, broadly speaking, are the reasons why my Government could not
support the present draft resolution and hopes that it will not pass. We
respect the views and the sincerity of those who have put it forward but we
regret that this issue, so divisive in the Council, is being pressed to a
vote. We regret this in particular because the unity of this Council in
handling what is recognised by all as being the most complex and difficult
international issue that has faced the Council in recent years is an absolute
prerequisite to achieving results. We hope that unity will soon be found
again and we for our part intend to work for it. That is the reason why I do
not intend to reply to some rather intemperate and unfounded remarks made by
the Ambassador of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
As I said earlier, the British Government has been at the forefront of
efforts to solve this crisis and we intend to continue that endeavour. On the
ground in Bosnia, we believe that top priority must now be given to making the
safe areas safer. No one suggests that the safe areas are a solution in
"themselves; they are a measure designed to stop the situation from"
deteriorating and to protect the lives of many thousands of innocent
refugees. We are encouraged by the response so far to the decisions of this
Council to reinforce UNPROFOR with 7,500 troops and to back up those troops
with the deterrent threat of air strikes.
In addition, the economic sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro are a
crucial part of the international community's efforts to bring about a lasting
and equitable solution. They must be sustained and strengthened in their
application. Goods are still getting through despite the efforts of the
Sanctions Advisory Missions of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe and of so many of the Governments bordering on Serbia and Montenegro.
S/PV.3247
135
(Sir David Hannay, United Kingdom)
It is crucial that the Bosnian Serbs and the authorities in Belgrade
understand that there will be no easing or lifting of these sanctions until
the conditions set out in the Security Council resolutions, most recently in
resolution 820 (1993), have been fulfilled.
We also believe that this Council must do everything in its power to
sustain and nourish the peace process. That does not mean that we should
support solutions which would be inequitable for one of the communities in
Bosnia. But it does mean that we should not falter in our willingness to look
at any approach which offers some hope of winning the support of all three
communities. The key thing is to stand firmly on the principles enunciated by
the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia with a view to assuring
the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, and to use as many of the building-blocks contained in the
Vance-Owen peace plan, even if the territorial map proposed in that plan is
now no longer a viable one. The European Council meeting at Copenhagen last
week reaffirmed its support for the efforts of the Co-Chairmen to reach a
settlement on this basis. The present round of discussions in Geneva is at a
crucial point. It is certainly too soon to say that a solution is emerging
but it is also too soon to write off those efforts or to damage them before
they have taken proper shape and can be judged against the basic principles
that any solution will have to fulfil if it is to get the support of the
international community.
In conclusion, I would repeat again the hope of my Government that in the
wake of this debate and the vote on this draft resolution, which we would much
rather have avoided, it will be possible to recreate a united effort by this
Council to bring peace to the former Yugoslavia aid a lasting and equitable
solution to Bosnia and Herzegovina.
S/PV.3247
136
Mr, MERIMEE (France) (interpretation from French): My Government
believes that the draft resolution should not be adopted, for reasons of
principle, timing and substance.
I begin with the reasons of principle. The role of the United Nations
and the Security Council is not to organize for war or to wage war. According
to the Charter, it is to contribute to the settlement of conflict by peaceful
means. Deciding to lift the arms embargo selectively would mean, contrary to
the principles of the Charter, setting out on the path of war and not of
peace.
The inapportune timing also militates against the draft resolution. The
proposed decision could only interfere disastrously with the Geneva talks. A
negotiating process is now under way. So long as it is continuing we have
reasons for hope and we have the duty to encourage the search for agreement
between the parties - all the parties.
Moreover, by its resolutions 836 (1993) and 844 (1993) the Security
Council decided to establish safe areas and guarantee their protection. It is
clear that the safe areas and lifting the arms embargo reflect totally
opposite rationales. Such a decision on the embargo would put an end to those
areas. The French Government believes that the safe areas, however imperfect,
must be given the maximum possible chance. In the very serious situation
prevailing in Bosnia and Herzegovina any action that may save human lives must
have priority. It is true that these are temporary measures, but they can be
implemented. According to information from the Secretariat, more than
6,000 men can be made available by the contributing countries at this stage.
As the Council knows, France has just taken on new commitments to strengthen
the protection of the areas.
S/PV.3247
137
(Mr» Merimee, Franca)
I should like finally to refer to the reasons of substance why my
Government is opposed to lifting the arms embargo. Such a decision could have
very dangerous consequences for the very existence of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
and therefore consequences that are contrary to the goal of the authors of the
draft resolution. That is all the more true since the deletion of the former
paragraph 4 of the draft resolution, which envisaged the possibility of air
strikes against heavy weapons in order to support the Government of the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
There would then be a real danger of a massive and possibly decisive
offensive by the Serbs, and even by the Croats, against the Muslims of Bosnia
and Herzegovina. That would mean even greater losses, new territorial
conquests and even the disappearance, pure and simple, of that State. The
alternative prospect, if the Muslims managed to contain the offensive, would
be of an internationalization of the conflict. Can we, by what would amount
to incitement to war, assume the crushing burden of contributing to an
expansion of the conflict? Should we take a decision whose inevitable
consequence would be the withdrawal of United Nations troops and an end to
humanitarian aid? We do not opt for those very serious prospects.
That is why, while understanding the motives of the sponsors of the draft
resolution, my Government cannot support such a text, which runs counter to
the policy of seeking a peaceful, lasting settlement to the conflict. That is
the line we follow, which was affirmed in the Washington statement of 22 May
and the statement of the European Council of 22 June.
I should like to add one point, inspired by certain statements. France
does not limit itself to merely talking. It acts. We have sent soldiers to
Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the beginning of July my country will have 6,300
men on the soil of the former Yugoslavia. We have already lost 11 men. If
S/PV.3247
138
(Mr. Merimee, France)
the whole world had done as much the representative of the Republic of Bosnia
and Herzegovina would have had less to include in his plea. The situation
would be different. My country, which is committed on the soil of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, will not accept lessons in morality from anyone.
Mr. VORONTSOV (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian):
The delegation of the Russian Federation cannot accept draft resolution
S/25997.
The position of principle of the Russian Federation on the Bosnian crisis
is that we should aim for a halt to the war as soon as possible, achieving a
political settlement and speeding up the process of seeking a formula for a
peaceful settlement which would satisfy all three sides within the context of
the territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Implementing the proposal in the draft resolution to lift the arms embargo on
the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina would not increase the chances of
"achieving such a settlement; on the contrary, it would simply open up the"
floodgates for an escalation of the war in the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. This could lead to results completely the opposite of the goals
proclaimed in the draft resolution by its authors.
Adopting the draft resolution could set off a chain reaction of military
and political steps by the Bosnian authorities which could fan even more the
fire of military action. The Geneva negotiating process, with the
participation of all three Bosnian sides, would be jeopardized, as would the
United Nations operation in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a whole
and the security of the contingents of Member States of the United Nations
currently deployed in that country.
S/PV.3247
139
(Mr. Vorontsov, Russian
Federation)
The Russian delegation has already had occasion to draw the attention of
the authors of the draft resolution to the fact that lifting the arms embargo
on the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina would push that country into an even
bigger war and lead to a sharp deterioration of the situation and an increase
in the hostilities, the bloodshed, the suffering and the death of the civilian
population on a scale unprecedented to date in that country.
Moreover, there would be a real danger that the conflict would spread
beyond the boundaries of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and that
neighbouring countries would become directly involved. The decision would
place insuperable barriers in the way of efforts by the international
community to find a resolution to the conflict and to ease the situation of
hundreds of thousands of people.
It is clear that under such circumstances it would be impossible to
ensure implementation of the decision taken by the Security Council to create
safe areas and to adopt other measures to limit or end the conflict.
Such developments would essentially be the exact opposite of what is
currently a possibility: achievement of agreement between the Bosnian sides
on a settlement of the conflict. The first round of talks between the parties
in Geneva shows that in direct contacts with each other they may find ways of
reaching agreement, elaborating new approaches in keeping with the present
realities. We believe that in the near future during their further talks they
will be able to move forward and achieve a definitive settlement.
S/PV.3247
140
(Mr. Vorontsov, Russian
Federation)
The Security Council cannot allow this real chance of finding a political
settlement to be lost. We must understand that there is simply no alternative
to such a settlement. Any attempts to impose a decision by military means or
by force would simply lead to further fratricide and devastation.
S/PV.3247
141
(Mr, Vorontsov, Russian
Federation)
In our view, any settlement in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina
that is to be lasting and viable must take account of the following points:
there must be a real cessation of hostilities by all parties, with very firm
"measures against those who violate the cease-fire; full account must be taken"
"of the legitimate concerns of all three parties; the territorial integrity of"
the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina must be preserved, irrespective of what
decision is taken on the country's internal structure - federation or
"confederation; there can be no recognition of the consolidation of territorial"
"or other gains won by force or through ""ethnic cleansing""; and the parties"
must make possible full implementation of all relevant resolutions and
decisions of the Security Council, including those related to the security of
United Nations peace-keeping forces and of humanitarian-assistance deliveries.
To the extent possible, whatever is done must be based on the
experiences, concepts and principles of the London Conference, the Vance-Owen
plan and the Washington Joint Action Programme. We must preserve the
requirement for agreement or consensus on international action on matters
"related to Bosnia; this is an absolute prerequisite for reaching and"
implementing any Bosnian settlement.
We were pleased to note that the decision taken on 22 June by the
European Council was largely consonant with that approach.
We support the peacemaking efforts of the international mediators.
Lord Owen and Mr. Stoltenberg, and are willing to participate actively in
promoting a settlement, including further efforts by the special
representative of the President of the Russian Federation to the talks on the
former Yugoslavia.
S/PV.3247
142
(Mr, Vorontsov, Russian
Federation)
We are trying to help establish a framework for a successful conclusion
to the negotiating process, one that would preserve the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, which is composed of its three communities. This must be
achieved by civilized means, not by diktat or force. Only in that way can we
quench the fires of war and restore peace to the land of Yugoslavia, which has
suffered so greatly.
Russia continues to support the concept of safe areas and of building up
an international presence in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina as one way
of making progress towards a peaceful settlement.
Adopting a resolution lifting the arms embargo could actually neutralize
the entire United Nations operation in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In view of what I have said, the Russian Federation would regard the
adoption of draft resolution S/25997 as inadvisable and counterproductive.
Mr. MARUYAMA (Japan): Japan is deeply concerned over the continuing
grave situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It fully shares the view that
effective measures should be taken to ensure an immediate cessation of
hostilities and a political solution to the conflict. After carefully
studying the draft resolution before us, however, my Government has arrived at
the painful decision that it cannot support it, for the following reasons:
First, Japan is concerned that the lifting of the arms embargo proposed
in the draft resolution would most certainly escalate military hostilities in
the area and in fact, by intensifying the violence, would eliminate the
possibility of resolving this conflict by peaceful political means. The
result would be that the people would have to fight it out. We find it
difficult to agree with such a solution.
S/PV.3247
143
(Mr. Maruyama, Japan)
Secondly, Japan continues to support the efforts of the Co-Chairmen of
the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia to achieve a just and
lasting peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and it remains steadfast in its
conviction that the conflict there must be settled through negotiations. It
is concerned that the draft resolution would adversely affect the renewed
efforts being made in Geneva at this very critical juncture.
My Government is also concerned that lifting the arms embargo would
negatively affect the humanitarian assistance being provided by the Office of
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and other
international humanitarian agencies, which is essential to alleviate the
plight of the civilian population. Only recently the Council adopted its
safe-areas resolution. Full and rapid implentation of that resolution is of
great importance.
We once again call upon all parties concerned to intensify their renewed
efforts to achieve a mutually acceptable solution through negotiation, rather
than seeking a solution by force. We urge them to engage in the talks in good
faith to achieve a just and lasting peace.
Mr. ERD&S (Hungary) (interpretation from French): Faced with the
tragedy in Bosnia and Herzegovina - which has no precedent in
post-Second-World-War European history - Hungary’s feelings are similar to
those of the sponsors of the draft resolution before us today. We have
followed developments in Bosnia and Herzegovina with a deathly feeling in our
soul, and we share the deep frustration this conflict arouses in many. It is
painful to have to admit that the international community has so far failed in
"its attempts to find a solution to the crisis. Aggression, ""ethnic cleansing"""
S/PV.3247
144-145
(Mr. Erdos, Hungary)
and intolerance are achieving a most spectacular triumph, which poses a mortal
threat to the future of a State Member of the United Nations.
Hungary continues to endorse the principles set out in the draft
resolution, including the cessation of hostilities, the withdrawal from
territories occupied by force, reversal of the consequences of the policy of
"""ethnic cleansing"", and restoration of the territorial integrity of the"
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Hungary thinks it enormously important to make a clear distinction
between the aggressor and the victim of aggression. If some cannot or do not
wish to make that distinction, if some merely take note that aggression has
occurred, that is a dismal portent for the future of the world. There is no
doubt that the policy of systematic accommodation and resignation and the
policy of simply accepting faits accomplis will encourage all forces in the
region and elsewhere who are considering settling their problems by invading
other peoples and devastating their lands.
Hungary considers it intolerable that one of the parties to the
conflict - the strongest - continues to be supplied with weapons from outside
sources while another party - the Government of the country which is the
victim of the aggression - has no such ability. The point is to halt all
supplies of weapons and ammunition to Bosnia and Herzegovina. To that end
international inspection facilities should be set up along all the borders of
Bosnia and Herzegovina, as indicated in resolution 838 (1993). The Serbs'
"heavy weapons must be placed under effective control; these are the weapons"
responsible for so much of the massacre. They have become the symbol for this
bizarre war, a symbol that stands for the Serb military. The Security Council
need only apply its own resolutions.
S/PV.3247
146
(Mr. Erdos, Hungary)
It is undeniable that today the Security Council is in a very delicate
situation. Hungary believes that these same principles must guide the Council
and be applied in settling all the crises that are troubling our world. The
international community has in fact recognized Bosnia and Herzegovina as a
sovereign, independent country, and all the measures contemplated in this
context must be determined on the basis of this act of recognition or on the
basis of the fact that that State is a Member of the United Nations. The
question that we are asking ourselves is whether, in the present
circumstances, the actions envisaged in the draft resolution would be capable,
in reality, of promoting a solution to the Bosnian problem and if the measures
it contemplates would be likely to bring the end of this tragedy any closer.
We continue to bear in mind that one of the possible options, given the
challenge presented by the war of aggression in Bosnia and Herzegovina, is
lifting the arms embargo on the Bosnian Government. Hungary does not rule out
"that option; it does not exclude it, in principle, a priori, because it is so"
evident that the situation that obtained in September 1991 when the measures
pursuant to Security Council resolution 713 (1991) were adopted bear very
little resemblance to the present state of affairs.
However, after carefully weighing the various arguments concerning the
draft resolution before us, we have arrived at the conclusion that, under
present circumstances, lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina
would not necessarily have a positive impact on subsequent developments in
that country and its vicinity. Here we are thinking of the very likely
possibility of renewed military offensives against the territories that are
S/PV.3247
147
(Mr, Erdos, Hungary)
still under Government control, of the renewed human suffering, of the end of
international humanitarian operations and of the dangers that lie in wait for
international personnel in the former Yugoslavia.
In our opinion, lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina would
be to admit the irreversible failure, and the end, of the efforts aimed at
seeking a negotiated, political solution to the war. The Security Council is
now in a position where it must appreciate the true weight of its
responsibility, as defined in the Charter, for maintaining international peace
and security. It must act with all wisdom, and in doing so learn the lessons
of its bitter experience so far.
Today there is a feeling in the Security Council - and this is a feeling
that, let us admit it, does not necessarily reflect preferences within the
United Nations as a whole, which rather tends to favour supporting the recent
efforts by the Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International
Conference on the Former Yugoslavia - that the current, crucial dealings
between the protagonists to the conflict should be given a chance. We cannot
conceal the fact that this road is strewn with many dangers, but before we
turn to the ultimate weapon available to the international community - before
we take that step - Hungary, which is very concerned by the present situation
and by the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the whole region, would wish
to give a last chance to the tireless efforts aimed at achieving a solution to
the crisis in that country that is worthy of the noble values of our
civilization at the end of the twentieth century.
These are the reasons <rhich lead Hungary to abstain in the voting on the
draft resolution in document S/25997.
S/PV.3247
148
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): I shall now put the
draft resolution (S/25997) to the vote.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:	Cape Verde, Djibouti, Morocco, Pakistan, United States of
America, Venezuela
Against:	None
Abstaining:	Brazil, China, France, Hungary, Japan, New Zealand, Russian
Federation, Spain, United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): The result of the
voting is as follows: 6 votes in favour, none against and 9 abstentions. The
draft resolution has therefore not been adopted, it having failed to obtain
the required number of votes.
I shall now call on those members of the Council who wish to make
statements following the voting.
Mrs. ALBRIGHT (United States of America): My Government has
consistently advocated lifting the arms embargo imposed by the Council on the
Government of Bosnia. In fact, our views on lifting the embargo have not
"changed since Secretary Christopher first presented them. In voting ""yes"" on"
today's draft resolution, the United States reaffirms its belief that the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a sovereign State and Member of the
United Nations, has a right to defend itself. This is not a perfect solution,
but the arms embargo mandated by the Council has had an unintended yet
devastating effect in favour of the aggressor: it has frozen in place a vast
disparity in arms. We do not believe that this body should deny the Bosnian
Government the wherewithal to defend itself in the face of brutal aggression
conducted by the Bosnian Serbs and their backers in Belgrade.
S/PV.3247
149
(Mrs. Albright, United States)
We therefore regret that the Council was unable to adopt the resolution
under consideration today.
Although the Council has not chosen to act today on the arms embargo, it
would be a grave mistake for the Bosnian Serbs to interpret today's action by
the Council as an endorsement of their intransigence or of their attempts to
use military force to change international boundaries and destroy a
neighbour. Nor should today's vote be seen as an indication that the
international community is willing to turn a blind eye to the gross violations
of human rights that have been committed in Bosnia, primarily by the Bosnian
Serbs. We will continue to insist that, if the authorities in Belgrade want
to rejoin the family of nations, they will have to stop the violence, stop the
killing, stop their aggressive war against the Bosnian State and comply with
all relevant Security Council resolutions. Until that day, the Council will
have no choice but to keep the pressure on.
Our goal remains a negotiated settlement freely agreed to by all the
parties. The United States believes that exempting the Bosnian Government
from the arms embargo is a means to that end.
The Council must continue to look for ways to restore its credibility on
this issue. We must continue to make clear that the status quo is
unacceptable. In the face jf continued obstructionism, my Government
continues to believe that all options for new and tougher measures must remain
open. No option should be prejudged or excluded from consideration.
S/PV.3247
150
Mr. LI Zhaoxina (China) (interpretation from Chinese): Since the
outbreak of the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina, China has always hoped that
the parties concerned would make concerted efforts to find an early solution
to the conflict by peaceful means. In conjunction with the international
community, we have made our own contributions to this end. At present, the
situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is deteriorating, characterized by the
escalation of conflict and ever-deepening suffering of its people. The
Chinese delegation cannot but express its deep concern and profound sympathy.
We therefore fully understand the concern and anxiety shown by the non-aligned
and Muslim countries over the fate of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
S/PV.3247
151
(Mr, Li Zhaoxinq, China)
The Chinese delegation holds that the sovereignty, political independence
and territorial integrity of all United Nations Member States should be fully
respected by the international community, as enshrined in the purposes and
principles of the United Nations Charter, which constitutes a basic norm
guiding international relations. We therefore support such elements in the
draft resolution as immediate cessation of hostilities, full respect for and
guarantee of the independence, unity and territorial integrity of the Republic
of Bosnia and Herzegovina and recognition of the right of all Bosnian refugees
to return to their homes. However, based on our consistent principled
position of finding by peaceful means a negotiated political solution to the
conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Chinese delegation abstained on the
vote on the draft resolution.
Mr. de ARAUJO CASTRO (Brazil): It is with a deep sense of the
gravity of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina that my delegation takes
part in the deliberations of the Security Council today.
Having followed with great concern the continuing deterioration of the
conflict in that country, the Government of Brazil is conscious of the
unbearable degree of violence and insecurity imposed on the innocent civilian
populations of Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the scourges of ethnic hatred and
intolerance have returned with blind fury, in disdain of the most basic rules
of international humanitarian law.
My delegation therefore understands and sympathizes with the objectives
that inspired the non-aligned members of the Security Council to take the
decision - which we fully respect - of requesting that the draft resolution
contained in document S/259J7 be put to the vote.
S/PV.3247
152
(Mr. de Araujo Castro, Brazil)
Many of the elements contained in the draft resolution deserve our
unreserved support. We are in agreement with the principles on which a
solution to the conflict should be based, as spelt out in the preambular part
of the text. An immediate cessation of hostilities must continue to be
"sought. The abhorrent practice that came to be known as ""ethnic cleansing"""
must stop at once, and steps should be taken to reverse its terrible
consequences, including by allowing all refugees to return to their homes. In
Bosnia and Herzegovina, as elsewhere, the acquisition of territories by the
use of force cannot be tolerated by the international community.
Notwithstanding those considerations, my delegation was not in a position
to vote in favour of the draft resolution.
Brazil continues to believe in the overwhelming importance of seeking a
comprehensive political solution to the Bosnian conflict. We also maintain
that the international community must aim its actions and decisions at
restraining and putting an end to the armed conflict and should avoid the risk
that, as a consequence of its actions and decisions, war might escalate or
expand. We are highly appreciative of the extraordinary work that has been
carried out both by the United Nations Protection Force and the humanitarian
agencies present in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and we would not like to see those
efforts brought prematurely to an end. Furthermore, there appear to be
grounds to fear that some of the measures envisaged in the draft resolution,
if they were to be implemented, could prompt drastic actions which would
affect the very populations that we would be trying to protect.
We are certain that all members of the Security Council - and, indeed, of
the United Nations - share the ultimate objective of finding an equitable and
sustainable solution for the unspeakably tragic conflict that rages in Bosnia
S/PV.3247
153
(Mr. de Araujo Castro, Brazil)
and Herzegovina. At this stage, however, we are not convinced that some of
the specific measures proposed in the draft resolution would be helpful in
attaining that goal. It is the view of the Brazilian Government that the
international community should not give up on the hope of reaching a peaceful
solution to the conflict.
Mr. KEATING (New Zealand): New Zealand shares the deep sense of
frustration about the situation in Bosnia that gave rise to this draft
resolution. The draft resolution responded to the concern we all have that
something must be done. However, we believe that a durable solution to the
situation in Bosnia should come through intensified efforts towards a
political settlement.
New Zealand has supported and continues to support United Nations
humanitarian efforts and Security Council measures, such as sanctions,
designed to persuade the parties of the need to look for a political
solution. We have contributed military personnel as United Nations military
observers in Yugoslavia.
But the action proposed in the draft resolution before the Council was of
a quite different nature. Lifting the arms embargo would, in our view,
immediately intensify the military pressure on the Bosnian forces, and that
would inevitably result in many more civilian casualties and many more
refugees. Just as inevitably, it would force an end to the United Nations
humanitarian operations.
In our view, it may still be possible for the principles of the
Vance-Owen plan to be forged into a settlement agreeable to all parties. It
is certainly our hope that they can be, and we should be very careful at this
point not to prejudice that possibility.
S/PV.3247
154-155
(Mr, Keating, New Zealand)
What does seem clear to us is that adopting this draft resolution would
have resulted in an intensified, head-on military confrontation. It would
have shut the door on any remaining chance for any peaceful resolution of the
situation, and it would have been seen, ultimately, as an abdication of the
responsibility of the United Nations to do its utmost to contribute to a
peaceful settlement. In essence, we believe that the draft resolution would
not have achieved the objective that was sought.
It may be that at some point the Council will have to admit that a
negotiated solution has eluded it and take appropriate action. We certainly
hope not, but we think it would be premature to do so now.
The Council's decision must not be misinterpreted as meaning the Council
has turned its back on the Bosnian people. Quite the contrary: the Council
established safe areas under resolution 836 (1993), and I would remind all
parties that the Council has decided to respond with force if those areas are
threatened. We now need to address urgently the practical implementation of
the safe areas.
I think we also need to be fully and regularly informed by the
Secretary-General's Special Represenatative about the progress of the
discussions in Geneva. As I have said, it is New Zealand's view that those
negotiations still provide the best hope for a durable political settlement,
but I must emphasize that it would be unacceptable for the negotiations to
move towards an outcome that was grossly disadvantageous to one of the
parties, such as the partition of Bosnia or the acquisition of territory by
force. That would simply s?w the seeds of future conflagration. That is the
message the Special Representative must convey in Geneva, and the Council must
continue to monitor developments very closely.
S/PV.3247
156
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): I shall now make a
statement in my capacity as representative of Spain.
The debate the Security Council has held today has made it clear that,
quite apart from the positions taken by the various sides, we all share the
same feeling of anguish and frustration at the continuation of the horrible
conflict assailing the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, notwithstanding the
efforts exerted so far by the international community.
Spain, in any event, understands and indeed, in large measure, shares the
motivations of the countries that sponsored the draft resolution that has been
voted on today. In particular, we uphold positions that are very similar to
the basic principles on which the solution to the conflict in Bosnia and
Herzegovina should be based.
I wish to recall in this context that Spain, together with the other
countries members of the European Community, has recently reaffirmed, at the
meeting of the Council of Europe held in Copenhagen on 22 June, that any
negotiated solution to the conflict must be based on the principles of the
London Conference, summed up in the Vance-Owen peace plan, and in particular
on the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, the protection of human rights and the rights of minorities, the
inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force, the vital need that
humanitarian assistance be provided to and reach those who need it, and the
bringing to justice of those who have committed war crimes and violations of
international humanitarian law.
S/PV.3247
157
(The President)
However, the delegation of Spain abstained in the voting that took place
today because it is convinced that the anguish, frustration and, indeed,
despair that we feel must not prompt us to take measures that might prove to
have negative conseguences and in fact be prejudicial to those whom we are
trying to help.
Indeed, it is our view that lifting the arms embargo, even though only
partially, would lead to an escalation of the violence and would only
contribute to increasing the suffering of the civilian population. What would
doubtless happen would be not just a quantitative but also a qualitative
upsurge in the fighting, as new and more modern weapons streamed in and
reached the hands of all the combatants - not merely one of the parties.
Moreover, the measures proposed in this draft resolution would, in our
judgement, escalate the risk of an expansion of the conflict, with potentially
extremely serious consequences for the entire region.
Yet another consideration which weighed heavily in our decision was the
conviction that lifting the arms embargo would be incompatible with the
maintenance of the presence of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)
in Bosnia and Herzegovina and that, therefore, the Office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the other humantarian
agencies would not be able to continue their important work of helping the
civilian population - and two-thirds of the population of Bosnia and
Herzegovina depend on those bodies for their survival.
We also feel that the adoption of this draft resolution would not have
been appropriate at this particular time, since it would have introduced a
disturbing element, which would probably have had an adverse effect on the
process of talks under way in Geneva, where we hope a negotiated solution will
be found that will bring an end to the conflict.
S/PV.3247
158
(The President)
In that context, I should like also to recall that the Council of Europe
in Copenhagen formally declared that it would not accept a territorial
solution dictated by the Serbs and the Croats of Bosnia at the expense of the
"Bosnian Muslims; at the same time, it expressed its full confidence in the"
co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the
Former Yugoslavia and urged them to pursue their efforts to promote a just and
viable solution for the three peoples making up Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It is our view, in particular, that we must not now abandon the efforts
to achieve the implementation of the relevant resolutions of the Security
Council, and in particular resolutions 836 (1993) and 844 (1993), recently
adopted on the question of safe areas. Guided by that spirit, the Heads of
State or Government of the States members of the European Community committed
themselves in Copenhagen to responding positively to the request by the
Secretary-General that troops and other resources be furnished for the
enhanced protection of the safe areas, and issued an appeal to the other
members of the international community to do their part.
If all these efforts do not bear the hoped-for fruit, Spain, together
with the other countries that signed the joint plan of action issued in
Washington on 22 May last, remains ready to consider, in due course, recourse
to new and more forceful measures, without prejudging or excluding
consideration of any of them.
We are, however, convinced that that time has not yet come. We remain
confident that reason will prevail and that the parties will manage to reach a
solution to the conflict by means of negotiation.
S/PV.3247
159
(The President)
I conclude by expressing the hope and the firm desire that we shall soon
see re-established the unity and cohesion of the Security Council that have
inevitably been affected by the vote taken today. It is essential to ensure
that the weight of the international community is brought to bear on all the
parties, particularly the Serbian party, so that a just and lasting solution
can be found to the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
I now resume my functions as President of the Council.
There are no further names on the list of speakers. The Security Council
has thus concluded the present stage of its consideraton of the item on its
agenda.
The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.
