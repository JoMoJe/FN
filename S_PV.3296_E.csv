ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
The agenda was adopted.
ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE PROSECUTION OF PERSONS
RESPONSIBLE FOR SERIOUS VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW COMMITTED
IN THE TERRITORY OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA
APPOINTMENT OF THE PROSECUTOR
The PRESIDENT: The Security Council will now begin its consideration
of the item on the agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them document S/26608, which contains
the text of a draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior
consultations.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to adopt the draft
resolution before it without a vote. Unless I hear any objection, I shall take
it that the draft resolution is adopted.
There being no objection, the draft resolution has been adopted as
resolution 877 (1993).
Mr. TAYLHARDAT (Venezuela) (interpretation from Spanish): The
delegation of Venezuela wishes to thank all the members of the Council for the
support for and confidence placed in, Mr. Ramon Escovar Salom to discharge the
very important duties of Prosecutor of the International Tribunal established to
pass judgement on serious violations of international humanitarian law in the
former Yugoslavia. We also wish to thank the Secretary-General for nominating
him.
The importance of this post, in our view, lies in the fact that only
justice will be able to contribute to healing, in time, the deep wounds caused
by the losses of human life and all the spiritual and moral injuries that the
war in the former Yugoslavia has inflicted on all the parties involved.
Peace and reconciliation will be lasting only if justice prevails and if
every abuse, without distinction, is brought to the Tribunal's attention and
those responsible are tried.
With this election, the process of constituting the Tribunal comes to an
end. Now one of the most important pillars of the peace process will be able to
begin its work and make its contribution to bringing to trial those allegedly

(Mr. Taylhardat, Venezuela)
guilty of violations of international humanitarian law committed in the former
Yugoslavia.
For Venezuela, this is a very important appointment and a great honour, and
I can assure the Council that Mr. Ramon Escovar Salom will come up to the
international community's expectations in the way he carries out his duties.
The PRESIDENT: There are no further speakers on my list.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on the agenda.
