ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
The agenda was adopted.
THE SITUATION IN THE REPUBLIC OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL PURSUANT TO SECURITY COUNCIL
RESOLUTION 836 (1993) (S/25939 and Corr.l and Add.l)
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of
Bosnia and Herzegovina in which he requests to be invited to participate in
the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In accordance with the
usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the discussion without the right to vote, in
conformity with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Misic (Bosnia and Herzegovina)
took a place at the Council table.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): The Security Council
will now begin its consideration of the item on the agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the report of the
Secretary-General pursuant to Security Council resolution 836 (1993), document
S/25939 and Corr.l and Add.l.
Members of the Council also have before them document S/25966, which
contains the text of a draft resolution submitted by France, the Russian
Federation, Spain, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and the United States of America.

(The President)
I should like to draw the attention of the Council to the following
documents:	S/25908, S/25909, S/25933, S/25943 and S/25959, letters dated 5,
6, 11, 13 and 16 June 1993 from the Permanent Representative of Bosnia and
Herzegovina to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security
Council.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to the vote
on the draft resolution before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall put
draft resolution S/25966 to the vote now.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:	Brazil, Cape Verde, China, Djibouti, France, Hungary, Japan,
Morocco, New Zealand, Pakistan, Russian Federation, Spain,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United
States of America, Venezuela
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): There were 15 votes in
favour. The draft resolution has been adopted unanimously as resolution
844 (1993).
I shall call now on those members of the Council who wish to make
statements following the voting.
Mr. ERDOS (Hungary) (interpretation from French): The Hungarian
delegation's vote in favour of resolution 844 (1993) reflects our conviction
that the intention of resolution 836 (1993) to establish safe areas in the
territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina must be implemented as quickly as possible.
For us, the only remaining question related to the specific modalities
proposed to do this. We must say that the modalities outlined in the present
resolution are not entirely what we had hoped for. They are acceptable
S/PV.3241
7
(Mr, Erdos, Hungary)
only to the extent that we had to face the fact that under the present
circumstances the international community is neither in a position, nor is it
inclined, to do more. Unfortunately, the consultations that preceded the
adoption of the resolution and the documents on which our decisions were based
convinced us that there is simply no real prospect of taking larger-scale,
more effective and less contradictory measures.
The present resolution has not rid us of the feeling we have had for some
time:	that the inherent characteristics of the structures we are building in
Bosnia and Herzegovina could in the circumstances prevailing in and around the
safe areas call into question the validity and operational aspects of those
structures. We might wonder whether the kinds of deterrence decided upon by
the Council will in fact be adequate to prevent the aggressor from pursuing
"his attempts to eliminate or ""neutralize"" the safe areas. Passive and"
minimally credible deterrent structures can easily become impotent, with a
loss of the capacity to act. It is cold comfort that this is not the first
time this has happened to us in the former Yugoslavia.
Hence, we can only hope that with the adoption of resolution 844 (1993)
we will achieve at least one of our objectives: urgently to protect the
people living in the safe areas and to halt the grave, systematic violations
of international humanitarian law. That would be consonant with the recent
appeal to the Security Council by the World Conference on Human Rights to take
the measures necessary to put an end to the genocide taking place in Bosnia
and Herzegovina - in particular, in Gorazde.
We hope that the measures proposed in the report of the
Secretary-General, which the Security Council has just approved through the
S/PV.3241
8
(Mr. Erdos, Hungary)
present resolution, will be taken as soon as possible and in such a way as to
make possible progress towards a fair overall settlement of the Bosnian
crisis, thus preventing fossilization of the structures we have planned.
Mr, WALKER (United States of America): My Government is pleased
that the Security Council has adopted this resolution implementing the
Secretary-General's report on safe areas in the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. We joined in sponsoring the resolution because we saw it as a
means to save lives in that tormented Republic and to facilitate meeting the
humanitarian needs of the Bosnian people.
This is another step forward in the international community's efforts to
achieve a lasting and equitable settlement of this terrible conflict. The
current resolution is obviously not the end of the process. As we meet, there
indeed are hopeful signs that a political settlement may once again be within
reach.
Once again, I note that the United States voted in favour of this
resolution as an intermediate step that does not foreclose options involving
tougher measures.
I reiterate that we expect the full cooperation of the Bosnian Serb party
in implementing this resolution. If that cooperation is not forthcoming, we
will move to seek further action in the Security Council. The violence must
stop. This resolution can be a decisive step in that direction.
Mr. MERIMEE (France) (interpretation from French): Two weeks ago
the Council with near unanimity adopted resolution 836 (1993) on safe areas in
S/PV.3241
9-10
(Mr. Merimee, France)
Bosnia and Herzegovina. We thought it essential that today the Council should
show its determination to continue on the path on which it set out with the
adoption of that resolution.
The new resolution we have just adopted approves the report of the
Secretary-General and decides to authorize the reinforcement of the United
Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) to meet the additional requirements
mentioned in paragraph 6 of the report as an initial report.
"This deployment is what we might call the ""light"" option - the only"
realistic option at present given the means that can be made available to
UNPROFOR in the short term. We think that those means, coupled with the
threat of air strikes, can deter attacks against the safe areas, in conformity
with resolution 836 (1993).
Clearly, speedy implementation of that resolution depends on Member
States. That is why the new resolution calls upon Member States to contribute
forces, including logistic support and equipment. In that connection, we hail
the generous offer of the Government of Pakistan and that of the Government of
Bangladesh. We hope other States will follow their example. We are certain
that the expressions of solidarity with Bosnia and Herzegovina by so many
delegations will be concretely in the provision of the means that UNPROFOR
requires.
S/PV.3241
11
Mr. VORONTSOV (Russian Federation)(interpretation from Russian):
The Russian Federation was a co-sponsor of the important resolution just
adopted by the Security Council, which envisages specific measures to provide
for the security of the safe areas in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We are grateful to the Secretary-General for his report in document S/25939,
which was prepared pursuant to Security Council resolution 836 (1993). We
believe that the recommendations in that report are an excellent basis for the
initiation of the implementation of the Council's decision to establish safe
areas in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Thus, a specific, concrete step is being taken to implement that
decision, whose purpose is to put an end to bloodshed, to allay the suffering
of the civilian population and to stabilize the situation. The idea of safe
areas is an important element in the programme adopted in Washington on 22 May
this year by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of Spain, the Russian
Federation, the United Kingdom, the United States and France - a programme of
joint actions aimed at exploring ways and means of extinguishing the Bosnian
conflagration and establishing a stable and lasting political settlement.
We share the Secretary-General's view that the implementation of the
decision to set up safe areas must be predicated upon the consent and
cooperation of all the Bosnian parties. We call upon them to become aware of
the full gravity of the situation and to embark on the course of cooperation
with the United Nations Protection Force in the process of implementing the
Security Council's resolutions on safe areas. These parties must clearly
realize that if they refuse such coopoeration this will involve the adoption
of new, tougher measures, none of which is either predetermined or ruled out.
S/PV.3241
12
Mr. McKINNON (New Zealand): We may be on the verge of change in the
overall political context in Bosnia, but New Zealand supports the resolution
just adopted because we wish to see Security Council resolution 836 (1993)
implemented as effectively and guickly as possible. The present resolution
constitutes a valuable initial step towards that goal. Its implementation
depends, of course, on sufficient forces and material being made available.
We thank those Member States that have indicated that they will be able
to contribute personnel to the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) for
the purposes of this extended mandate. We also welcome the offer made by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to provide air power in and around
the safe areas in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in support of
UNPROFOR. The provision for air power to be deployed in this way and for this
purpose is a key element in resolution 836 (1993).
At long last, United Nations military observers have been permitted to
enter Gorazde, one of the six safe areas designated in resolution 836 (1993).
What they have found there confirms our worst fears about what happened in
Gorazde in the weeks before the observers were admitted. It is good that the
military observers are now in Gorazde, but it is not enough. All parties must
respect the safe areas, must comply fully with resolution 836 (1993) and must
commit themselves to a negotiated settlement of the conflict which rages in
Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Latest reports available to Council members seem to indicate an increase
in the level of incidents against United Nations personnel. We sympathize
with those nations that have lost soldiers in these incidents. These events
make it all the more imperative to implement speedily today's resolution and
resolution 836 (1993).
S/PV.3241
13
Sir David HANNAY (United Kingdom): My Government welcomes the
speedy adoption of this resolution endorsing the Secretary-General's report.
We particularly welcome the fact that the Security Council has achieved its
unity in this matter and is going forward by unanimity.
My Government believes that it was necesesary to follow up as quickly as
possible the immediate steps that were identified in the joint action
programme agreed in Washington some three weeks ago - steps of which this was
perhaps the most significant.
Of course, as others have said, the safe-areas policy and this
reinforcement of it is not in itself a solution to the problems of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. But it is, in our view, a step in the right direction, designed
to make the safe areas safer and to assist the major humanitarian effort in
which my country, along with France, Spain, Canada and others, have been
involved for eight months now and in the course of which many innocent lives
have been saved.
We hope very much that there will be a good and rapid response to the
request the Secretary-General is now making for troops and equipment. We very
much welcome the fact that some countries have already come forward to the
Secretary-General and made offers in both these fields.
Of course, the safe-areas policy must be set in a wider context, and that
wider context must be the continued search for a lasting and equitable
political settlement - a search on which there must be no let-up.
Mr. de ARAUJO CASTRO (Brazil):	On the occasion of the adoption by
the Security Council of resolution 836 (1993) two weeks ago, my delegation
noted that in due course that resolution should be complemented by appropriate
additional measures. We also stated that the decision taken then by the
Security Council should have a two-fold objective, the fulfilment of which
S/PV.3241
14
(Mr. de Araujo Castro, Brazil)
would serve as the yardstick against which the effectiveness of that
resolution would be measured: immediately, or in the very short run, to
preserve the safety of and ensure minimum living conditions for the
"populations in the safe areas; and at a later stage, to be reached as quickly"
as possible, to restore full normalcy to life in those areas.
It may be too early to try to assess objectively the practical effects of
resolution 836 (1993), or even of the last half dozen resolutions out of a
total of almost 40 adopted by the Security Council on matters related to the
former Yugolavia. However, one cannot fail to note a dramatic acceleration of
the process of deterioration that has characterized the situation in Bosnia
and Herzegovina for the last few months. It is thus understandable that many
may feel disappointed and frustrated by the way the international community
has been handling the Bosnian conflict. The Security Council must acknowledge
its share of responsibility in this regard.
The Council has recently adopted resolutions on the establishment of an
international tribunal, on the possible deployment of monitors along the
Bosnian borders, and on the expansion of the concept of safe areas. So far,
those decisions have had scant, if any, positive bearing on the actual
situation on the ground.
In his latest report on this issue, which is both realistic and subdued,
the Secretary-General makes it clear that the effective implementation of the
provisions of the resolution just adopted, which will depend upon the consent
and cooperation of the parties - an element that remains less than certain -
will not increase the current levels of protection provided to humanitarian
convoys of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
"(UNHCR), currently exposed to continuous harassment by all parties; nor will"
S/PV.3241
15
(Mr. de Araujo Castro, Brazil)
it guarantee the defence of the safe areas, which should be its immediate
goal.
The action taken today by the Security Council in adopting resolution
844 (1993) has none the less the merit of giving a more practical dimension to
the serious measures envisaged in resolution 836 (1993) and, as such, deserves
the support of my delegation. It should be seen, once again, as an additional
step in the so-far-elusive process of searching for a lasting peace in Bosnia
and Herzegovina.
We particularly value the reference in the resolution to the overwhelming
importance of seeking a comprehensive political solution to the conflict in
the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This reference, which echoes the
opinion expressed by the Secretary-General in his report, reminds us that the
ultimate objective of the Security Council remains the attainment of a truly
sustainable settlement of that conflict.
S/PV.3241
16
(Mr. de Araujo Castro, Brazil)
The achievements of the Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the
International Conference on the former Yugoslavia continue to provide an
appropriate framework for the pursuit of a lasting solution to the Bosnian
problem. Brazil is convinced that, in order to be effective, any such
solution must necessarily take into account the legitimate interests of all
the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina and ensure protection for the rights of
minorities.
For too long the world community has been witnessing the perpetration of
heinous crimes and gross violations of international humanitarian law in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. Let us hope that the decision taken today by the
Security Council will prove to be more than just one additional link in a very
long chain of measures and may effectively contribute to stopping the killing
and bringing about a sound resolution to the Bosnian conflict.
Mr. SHIGEIE (Japan): My delegation continues to be gravely
concerned over the continuing and intolerable situation in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. The unceasing military attacks and hostilities are further
worsening the plight of the civilian population, as seen in Srebrenica and,
more recently, in Gorazde.
"Previously this Council unanimously adopted a resolution ""to ensure full"
"respect for the safe areas"" (resolution 836 (1993), para, 4) and ""extend..."
"the mandate of UNPROFOR"" (ibid., para, 5) to protect those areas. The"
proposals made by the Secretary-General to implement that resolution are very
realistic and necessary, given the grave situation prevailing and the
available resources. We hope that the deployment of forces will be carried
out as rapidly as possible.
While we work on the humanitarian situation, it remains all the more
important to strive to find a comprehensive political resolution. That
S/PV.3241
17
(Mr. Shiqeie, Japan)
comprehensive resolution must be found through talks and negotiations. In
that connection, my Government is following closely and with much interest the
talks begun recently in Geneva among the parties concerned and with the
Co-Chairmen of the International Conference.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): I shall now make a
statement in my capacity as representative of Spain.
We welcome the unanimous adoption of resolution 844 (1993), of which
Spain was a sponsor. The report of the Secretary-General responds to the
request contained in resolution 836 (1993), and its adoption by the Council is
the essential step for the practical application of whatever is needed to
implement that resolution.
The continuing deterioration of the situation on the ground, which the
Government of Spain follows with great concern, makes increasingly relevant
and acute the need for the safe areas and their civilian population to have
"adequate protection, which certainly requires the cooperation of the parties;"
but it also requires the strengthening of UNPROFOR along with other support
measures, including air cover.
We therefore hope for favourable responses to the requests of the
Secretary-General for the provision of additional contingents of troops and
the necessary equipment and logistical support. We particularly welcome the
fact that several countries have already indicated their willingness in that
regard. Spain, for its pa~t, will continue to contribute to UNPROFOR efforts
by means of the contingent it has already deployed in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
whose troops are being duly reinforced and which operates along the
Metkovic-Mostar-Sarajevo route, identified in the Secretary-General's report
as vital to the maintenance of the United Nations efforts in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, and particularly now for the protection of the safe areas.
S/PV.3241
18
(The President)
We understand that strengthening UNPROFOR, as now authorized, is an
initial measure which, we hope, will be adequate, but which does not exclude
further strengthening, if that should be necessary, in order to achieve the
objectives set out in resolution 836 (1993).
None of this should exempt us - rather the contrary - from the search for
a comprehensive, equitable and lasting solution to the conflict in Bosnia and
Herzegovina and, in general, to the crisis in the former Yugoslavia, a
solution which is at this time more urgent than ever.
I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.
There are no further speakers on my list. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.
The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.
The meeting rose at 4.05 p.m.
