ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
The agenda was adopted.
THE SITUATION IN CROATIA
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): I should like to inform
the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of Croatia, in
which he requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on
the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with
the consent of the Council, to invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions
of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Nobilo (Croatia) took a place at
the Council table.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): The Security Council
will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.
Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been
authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:
"""The Security Council expresses its profound concern at the reports"
from the Secretariat of recent military hostilities in Croatia, in
particular the escalation of the means employed, and the grave threat they
pose to the peace process in Geneva and overall stability in the former
Yugoslavia.
"""The Council reaffirms its respect for the sovereignty and territorial"
integrity of the Republic of Croatia, and calls on both sides to accept
UNPROFOR's proposal of an immediate cease-fire. It calls on the Croatian
Government to withdraw its armed forces to positions occupied before
9 September 1993, on the basis of that proposal, and calls on the Serbian
"forces to halt all provocative military actions."""
