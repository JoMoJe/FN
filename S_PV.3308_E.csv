ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
The agenda was adopted.
THE SITUATION IN THE REPUBLIC OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
The PRESIDENT: I should like to inform the Council that I have
received a letter from the representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina in which he
requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions
of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Sacirbey (Bosnia and Herzegovina)
took a place at the Council table.
The PRESIDENT: The Security Council will now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them documents S/26690 and S/26692,
which contain the texts of letters dated 3 and 8 November 1993 from the Charge
d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Croatia to the United Nations and
from the Permanent Representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the United
Nations, respectively, addressed to the President of the Security Council.
Members of the Council have also received photocopies of a letter dated
9 November 1993 from the Charge d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of
Croatia to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security
Council, which will be issued as document S/26715.
Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been
authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:
"""The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the reports on the"
deterioration of the situation in Central Bosnia where increased military
activities are seriously threatening the security of the civilian
population.
"""The Security Council demands that all parties and others concerned"
refrain from taking any action that threatens the safety and well-being of
the civilian population.

(The President)
"""The Security Council is equally concerned at the overall humanitarian"
situation prevailing in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It
reiterates its demand to all parties and others concerned to guarantee
unimpeded access for humanitarian assistance.
"""The Security Council, aware of the heavy burden that these"
developments add to the existing precarious humanitarian situation of the
refugees and displaced persons in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina
and in the surrounding countries, calls on all parties to assist the
competent United Nations agencies and other humanitarian organizations in
their efforts to provide relief to the affected civilian population in
those countries.
"""The Security Council urges all parties and others concerned to exert"
the utmost restraint and refrain from taking any action which might
"exacerbate and situation."""
The statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under
the symbol S/26716.
Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been
authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:
"""The Security Council is profoundly shocked to learn of the incident"
which took place on 8 November 1993 in which two persons were taken hostage
by the Bosnian Serb forces while members of the delegation headed by
Monsignor Vinko Puljic, the Archbishop of Sarajevo, travelling to the city
of Vares on a mission of peace under the protection of the United Nations
Protection Force (UNPROFOR).
"""The Security Council strongly condemns this outrageous act, which is"
a flagrant challenge to the authority and inviolability of UNPROFOR.
"""The Council takes note that, despite the prompt and commendable"
intervention of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General,
neither of the hostages has been released and demands that the Bosnian Serb
forces proceed immediately to release them. The Council reminds the
perpetrators of this act that they are obligated to ensure that no harm
comes to the individuals being held and that those responsible for
violations of international humanitarian law will be held personally
accountable for their actions.

(The President)
"""The Security Council requests the Secretary-General to undertake a"
thorough investigation of the incident and to report to the Council without
delay. It urges all parties and others concerned to refrain from taking
any action which might further exacerbate the situation.
"""The Security Council condemns all attacks and hostile acts against"
UNPROFOR by all parties in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well
as in the Republic of Croatia, which have become more frequent over the
"last weeks, and demands that they cease forthwith."""
This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under
the symbol S/26717.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on the agenda.
The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.
