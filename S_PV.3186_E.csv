(The President)
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in the course of its prior consultations.
Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have
been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:
"""The Security Council warmly welcomes the signature by"
President Alija Izetbegovic and Mr. Mate Boban of all four documents of
the Peace Plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina worked out by the Co-Chairmen
of the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the Former
Yugoslavia.
"""On this important occasion the Security Council pays tribute to the"
untiring efforts of the Co-Chairmen, Secretary Vance and Lord Owen.
"""The Council commends the action of the two parties who have signed"
all the documents and calls on the remaining party to sign without delay
the two documents of the Peace Plan that it has not already signed and to
cease its violence, offensive military actions, 'ethnic cleansing' and
obstruction of humanitarian assistance.
"""The Council calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities by all"
parties.
"""The Council looks forward to receiving a report from the"
Secretary-General on the developments in the International Conference and
stands ready to take action to follow up on the report and to take the
"steps required to bring about the peace settlement""."
