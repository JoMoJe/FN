"The PRESIDENT; The Security Council will now begin its"
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have received photocopies of letters dated
8 January 1993 from the Permanent Representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina to
the United Nations and the Permanent Representative of Turkey to the United
Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council, which will be
issued as Security Council documents under the symbols S/25074 and S/25077
respectively.
Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have
been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:
"""The Security Council is profoundly shocked to learn of the killing"
of Mr. Hakija Turajlic, Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs of the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, by Bosnian-Serb forces, while he was
under the protection of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR).
"""The Council strongly condemns this outrageous act of terrorism"
which is a grave violation of international humanitarian law and a
flagrant challenge to the authority and the inviolability of UNPROFOR, as
well as to the serious efforts undertaken with the aim of achieving an
overall political settlement of the crisis.
"""The Council urges all parties and others concerned to exercise the"
utmost restraint and to refrain from taking any action which might
further exacerbate the situation.

(The President)
"""The Council requests the Secretary-General to undertake a full"
investigation of the incident and to report to it without delay. Upon
receipt of that report the Council will consider the matter forthwith.
"""The members of the Security Council extend their sincere"
condolences to the bereaved family of Mr. Turajlic and to the people and
"the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina""."
The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.
The meeting rose at 9.20 p.m.
