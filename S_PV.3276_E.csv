ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
The agenda was adopted.
THE SITUATION IN THE REPUBLIC OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
"The PRESIDENT; I should like to inform the Council that I have"
received a letter from the representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in which he
requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions
of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Sacirbey (Bosnia and Herzegovina)
took a place at the Council table.
The PRESIDENT: The Security Council will now begin its consideration
of the item on its agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.
Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have been
authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:
"""The Security Council expresses its profound concern over recent"
reports that Bosnian Croats have been holding Bosnian Muslims in detention
camps under deplorable conditions. The Council recalls the international
revulsion and condemnation that accompanied revelations last year of the
conditions under which Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats were being held
in Bosnian Serb detention camps.

(The President)
"""The Council reiterates the principle that the International Committee"
of the Red Cross (ICRC) must be given access to all detainees in Bosnia
wherever they may be held. It notes that the ICRC has recently been given
access to some detainees, but recalls with condemnation the obstacles which
the Bosnian Croats have previously placed in the way of the ICRCs attempts
to gain access to the camps in order to ascertain the conditions of the
detained. It also notes the recent appeal addressed by the President of
Croatia to the Bosnia Croats (S/26419).
"""The Council emphasizes the fact that inhumane treatment and abuses in"
detention centres violates international humanitarian law. Moreover, as
the Council has previously recalled, persons who commit or order the
commission of grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions are individually
responsible in respect of such breaches.
"""The Council calls upon the Bosnian Croats to supply immediately to"
the ICRC complete information on all camps where Bosnian Muslim and any
other prisoners are being held, and to assure the ICRC and all other
legitimately concerned international bodies free and unhindered access to
the detained, wherever they may be held.
"""The Council believes that the Government of Croatia has a"
responsibility to use its influence with the Bosnian Croats to secure
compliance with this statement and calls on the Government of Croatia to
take immediate steps to that end.
"""The Council further reaffirms that all parties to the conflict are"
bound to comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law
and in particular the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and reminds
them of its willingness to consider appropriate actions if any of them
should fail to abide scrupulously by their obligations.
"""The Council decides to remain seized of the matter."""
