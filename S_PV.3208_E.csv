TRIBUTE TO THE MEMORY OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF
SRI LANKA
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Russian): It is with great
sorrow that the members of the Security Council have learned of the tragic
death on Saturday, 1 May 1993, of the President of the Democratic Socialist
Republic of Sri Lanka, His Excellency Mr. Ranasinghe Premadasa. President
Premadasa was deeply committed to the ideals of the United Nations and the
cause of world peace. His loss will be deeply mourned by the international
community. On behalf of the Security Council, I wish to express profound
condolences to the Government and the people of Sri Lanka and heartfelt
sympathy to the bereaved family.
I now invite members of the Council to stand and observe a minute of
silence.
The members of the Council observed a minute of silence.

The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Russian): As this is the first
meeting of the Security Council for the month of May, I should like to take
this opportunity to pay a tribute, on behalf of the Council, to
Mr. Jamsheed K. A. Marker, Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the United
Nations, for his service as President of the Security Council for the month of
April 1993. I am sure I speak for all members of the Security Council in
expressing deep appreciation to Ambassador Marker for the great diplomatic
skill and unfailing courtesy with which he conducted the Council’s business
last month.
ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
The agenda was adopted.
THE SITUATION IN THE REPUBLIC OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
REPORT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL MISSION ESTABLISHED PURSUANT TO RESOLUTION
819 (1993) (S/25700)
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Russian): I should like to
inform the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of
Bosnia and Herzegovina, in which he requests to be invited to participate in
the discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In accordance with the
usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the discussion without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr, Sacirbey (Bosnia and Herzegovina)
took a place at the Council table.
S/PV.3208
7
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Russian): The Security Council
will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda. The Security
Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in its prior
consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the report of the Security
Council mission established pursuant to resolution 819 (1993), document
S/25700. Members of the Council also have before them document S/25722, which
contains the text of a draft resolution which was prepared in the course of
the Council’s prior consultations.
I should like to draw the attention of members of the Council to the
following documents: S/25710, letter dated 30’ April 1993 from the Charge
d’affaires ad interim of the Permanent Mission of Yugoslavia to the United
"Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council; S/25714, letter"
dated 30 April 1993 from the Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the
"United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General; S/25718, S/25728 and"
S/25730, letters dated 4 and 5 May respectively, from the Permanent
Representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the United Nations addressed to
the President of the Security Council.
Members of the Council have also received photocopies of a letter dated
6 May 1993 from the Permanent Representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the
United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council, which will
be issued as document S/25731.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to vote on
the draft resolution before it. If I hear no objection, I shall take it that
that is the case.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
Before putting the draft resolution to the vote, I shall call on those
members of the Council who wish to make statements before the voting.
S/PV.3208

Mr. MERIMEE (France) (interpretation from French): I should like to
extend to you, Sir, the congratulations of my delegation on your assumption of
the presidency of the Security Council. My delegation also wholeheartedly
endorses the compliments you addressed to Ambassador Marker, our President
last month.
The draft resolution before us today is intended to convey the feelings
and concern of our Council in the face of what must be considered a further
deterioration in the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and a growing threat
to the security of the civilian populations in a number of communities,
particularly in the eastern part of the country. True, the information at our
disposal is fragmentary, but the Council's concern is heightened by the fact
that the military observers whom the United Nations Protection Force tried to
send to Zepa to gain an overview of the situation were prevented from reaching
their destination.
In requesting all the parties concerned henceforth to treat the cities of
Zepa, Gorazde, Tuzla, Bihac and Sarajevo as safe areas, free from armed
attacks and from any other hostile acts likely to endanger the well-being and
the safety of their inhabitants, the Security Council intends first and
foremost to send the clearest and most humanitarian signal to the fighting
parties: The civilian populations must no longer be made to bear the
consequences of the Bosnian conflict. In that regard, the example of the city
of Srebrenica has given us valuable experience by showing us both the limits
and advantages arising from the establishment of a safe area. The most
important thing is protection, to save the human lives seriously threatened by
the extension of the conflict.
S/PV.3208
9-10
(Mr, Merimee, France)
France/ heavily represented at the military level in Bosnia and
Herzegovina under United Nations auspices/ is already fulfilling its duty to
protect the safe areas in the Bihac region and in Sarajevo itself. I should
like to make an urgent appeal to the United Nations Member States that are
parties to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe - major
guarantors of international peace and security - to contribute as soon as
possible to assuming and protecting other safe areas. Their participation in
this humanitarian mission would be an increased guarantee of protection for
the unfortunate civilian populations of Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose lives we
all wish to save and whose hardships we all wish to lighten.
S/PV.3208
11
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Russian): I thank the
representative of France for the kind words he addressed to me.
I shall now put the draft resolution contained in document S/25722 to the
vote.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour: Brazil, Cape Verde, China, Djibouti, France, Hungary, Japan,
Morocco, New Zealand, Pakistan, Russian Federation, Spain,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United
States of America, Venezuela
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Russian): There were 15 votes in
favour. The draft resolution has therefore been adopted unanimously as
resolution 824 (1993).
I shall call now on those members of the Council who wish to make
statements following the voting.
Mrs. ALBRIGHT (United States of America): Let me congratulate you,
Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Council in what clearly
promises to be another very eventful month.
I also offer our deepest thanks to the representative of Pakistan, who
brilliantly carried out the very difficult job of President during the month
of April.
We had hoped to be able to vote in the Council today on a draft
resolution that would at long last have begun the long road back to peace in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. Instead we have voted on a resolution to halt Serbian
aggression. Once again the Bosnian Serb leadership has thumbed its nose at
the values that everyone in this room holds dear. As United States Secretary
of State Christopher said in Brussels earlier today, the decision of the
S/PV.3208
12
(Mrs, Albright, United States)
so-called Bosnian Serb parliament has made a mockery of the signatures in
Athens, We are not inclined to invest the proposed referendum with
legitimacy, as it appears to be another cynical ploy to delay while the
Bosnian Serbs continue to roll up additional territory. As a result, our
focus will continue to be on the new, stronger measures on which President
Clinton has decided.
I ask my fellow Council members to reflect briefly on the irony of what
has transpired over the past week. On Sunday in Athens the self-styled leader
of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, signed the remaining portions of the
Vance-Owen agreements. He conditioned his signature, however, on the approval
of the so-called Bosnian Serb parliament. This unelected group of dubious
characters declined to ratify the agreements, instead calling for them to be
put to a referendum at some point later this month.
We are thus faced with the self-declared parliament of a self-declared
"leader stating that it needs the agreement of the ""people"" to stop the killing"
for which they are themselves to blame. We have not doubt that those
responsible for war crimes will be allowed to participate in the referendum if
it ever occurs. We doubt, however, that those who have been forced from their
homes at gunpoint will	be allowed	to participate. We know that	those who	now
enjoy the peace of the	grave will	not participate. This is not	democracy	in
"action; this is simply a ruse to buy time for further territorial conquest."
Let us be honest:	the current resolution is a palliative.	The only
solution is for the Bosnian Serbs	to agree to peace, to live in	tolerance	of
their neighbours and to give up for judgement those who have plunged their
country into war and fouled the good name of the Serbian people. Let me
remind the Bosnian Serb leadership that my Government has in recent days made
S/PV.3208
13
(Mrs. Albright, United States)
it clear that we are consulting with our allies about new, stronger and tougher
measures. Their implementation, or lack thereof, of this and all other
relevant Council resolutions in the next days will determine whether we and the
rest of the international community decide that the use of force is inevitable.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Russian): I thank the
representative of the United States for the kind words she addressed to me.
Sir David HANNAY (United Kingdom): Let me welcome your accession to
the Chair, Sir, and congratulate Ambassador Marker on the remarkable work he
did last month, the successes he chalked up, and the way in which he led our
work, which was really splendid.
I should like to make a very few remarks. In the first of them, I would
like to salute the men and officers of the United Nations Protection Force
(UNPROFOR), and particularly the Canadian troops, as well as the officials of
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and
other agencies, who have helped give effect to Security Council resolution
819 (1993), which set up a safe area at Srebrenica. They have worked under
truly appalling conditions, and they have achieved what they have achieved
against all the odds. I think we owe them a great debt for that.
It is really deplorable that we are here again today confronted with
attacks against civilian population centres - population centres which are
very frequently crowded with refugees - and that these attacks are being
carried out by the Bosnian Serbs in many different parts of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, some of which are listed in the resolution the Council has just
adopted. This is being done in complete disregard for the professed desire to
seek peace.
S/PV.3208
14
(Sir David Hannay, United Kingdom)
If the Bosnian Serbs have any wish at all to be considered sincere in
their desire for peace, they will heed the terms of today's resolution. If
they do not heed those terms, they will sacrifice and forfeit any sympathy
whatsoever.
From a wider point of view, my Government deplores, and expresses its
deep regret at, the failure of the Bosnian Serbs last night to endorse the
agreements reached at Athens and signed by their representative. This act of
folly cannot be justified. But we believe that this Council should not take
no for an answer. We must now keep up the pressure by all means to get back
on the path to peace, which is represented by the plan and the process into
which so much effort has gone on the part of the representatives of the
Secretary-General and of the European Community.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Russian): I thank the
representative of the United Kingdom for the kind words he addressed to me.
Mr. MARKER (Pakistan): Allow me to begin by extending my
delegation’s congratulations to you. Sir, on your assumption of the presidency
of the Council for this month. We are confident that under your
distinguished, experienced and able leadership the Council will adopt
well-considered and effective measures on many of the important issues with
which it is confronted.
I would also wish to associate my delegation with the profound
condolences expressed by you. Sir, on behalf of the Council, on the tragic
demise of President Premadasa of the Democratic Socialist Republic of
Sri Lanka. We share the grief of the family of President Premadasa and of the
people of Sri Lanka at their tragic bereavement.
S/PV.3208
15
(Mr, Marker, Pakistan)
My delegation is pleased at the unanimous adoption of resolution
824 (1993). We are deeply concerned at the escalation in armed hostilities by
the Bosnian Serbs against several towns in the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. We are particularly alarmed at the mounting Serbian armed
attacks on civilian populations in many threatened areas, in particular the
towns of Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zepa and Goradze and their surrounding areas. We
believe that the adoption of the present resolution declaring these threatened
areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina as safe areas will go a long way to ensuring
the safety of civilian populations in these regions.
The international community is witnessing escalating defiance of its will
by the Bosnian Serbs. In total disregard of the mandatory resolutions of the
Security Council, the Bosnian Serbs have persisted in their repulsive policy
"of ""ethnic cleansing"" and genocide. The time has come for the Council to act"
rapidly and firmly to compel the Serbian side to accept the Vance-Owen peace
plan.
S/PV.3208
16
(Mr. Marker, Pakistan)
We believe that the Security Council must take immediate appropriate measures,
including the authorization of the use of force under Chapter VII of the
United Nations Charter, to ensures the placing of all heavy weapons in the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under effective international physical
"control or neutralizing them to render them inoperative; the interdiction of"
"all arms supplies to the Bosnian Serbs; the institution of appropriate"
measures for reparations for the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina by
"Serbia and Montenegro; that Serbia and Montenegro is liable, under"
international law, for any direct loss or damage, including environmental
damage, or injury to foreign Governments, nationals and corporations as a
"result of its aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina; and"
the effective imposition of a complete and comprehensive economic and
financial blockade against Serbia and Montenegro.
We also believe that States Members of the United Nations should extend
their cooperation to the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the exercise of
its inherent right of individual and collective self-defence in accordance
with Article 51 of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, including the
supply of arms to enable them to defend themselves.
"The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Russian); I thank the"
representative of Pakistan for the kind words he addressed to me.
"Mr, YANEZ BARNUEVO (Spain) (interpretation from Spanish); As this"
is the first time that my delegation has spoken this month, we should like to
express to you, Sir, our congratulations and our admiration for the job that
you are doing. I should also like to join you, Mr. President, and other
delegations in expressing thanks to our outgoing President, Ambassador Marker
of Pakistan.
S/PV.3208
17
(Mr. Yanez Barnuevo, Spain)
The delegation of Spain not only joined in the adoption of the resolution
but also considers this resolution extremely timely and important. The
situation continues to deteriorate in various areas of the Republic of Bosnia
and Herzegovina, requiring, in our opinion, determined action by the United
Nations in order to protect the civilian population of those towns and areas
that are currently most exposed to the consequences of the armed conflict.
We are indebted to the mission sent by the Security Council - coordinated
by Ambassador Arria of Venezuela and composed of representatives of Russia,
France, Hungary, New Zealand and Pakistan - for the detailed report on the
general situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and, more specifically, on those
regions and towns most affected. The report also includes recommendations on
the establishment of safe areas, which requires the cooperation of the
parties. In addition, the cooperation of the United Nations Protection Force
(UNPROFOR) is anticipated within its mission of humanitarian protection.
This task - protecting individuals threatened by the conflict - has been
a priority at all times, but now more so than ever. This can no longer
suffice, however. We must go further in order to bring peace to the entire
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and to put an end to the threat to that
entire region. For that reason, we are convinced that we must, come what may,
put into effect the peace plan developed as a result of the great efforts by
Mr. Owen and Mr. Vance and, now, with the cooperation of Mr. Stoltenberg and
with the support of the European Community and the United Nations.
We would like to point out that this resolution - as the text itself
states, both in the preamble and in the operative part - falls within the
framework of what has been provided for in the peace plan. That is to say, it
is not a question of finding an alternative way, but of anticipating certain
S/PV.3208
18
(Mr. Yanez Barnuevo, Spain)
aspects of the implementation of the peace plan along the lines laid down by
the Security Council and with the use of UNPROFOR and the other means made
available by the United Nations Secretariat.
We are convinced that it will be necessary to keep up the pressure,
especially on the Bosnian Serbs, without ruling out other measures in the
coming days and weeks, in order to ensure that the Bosnian Serbs will ratify
the signature of the peace plan. This has not been confirmed, but
confirmation must be explicitly made. In particular, the various provisions
of the peace plan must be implemented fully and in good faith.
In conclusion, the Government of Spain wishes to emphasize the need for
unanimity among the members of the international community in the difficult
course of action that lies ahead of us. The Security Council has set an
example today by acting swiftly and unanimously. We hope that in the coming
days - tomorrow if necessary - we will continue in the same spirit and with
the same unanimity.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Russian): I thank the
representative of Spain for the kind words he addressed to me.
Mr. ERDOS (Hungary) (interpretation from French): I should like to
congratulate you. Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Council,
and I should also like to thank Ambassador Marker for the outstanding work he
did during the previous month.
Hungary voted in favour of resolution 824 (1993) on safe areas because
this resolution underlines, with a force that everyone can see, the concern of
the Security Council and the international community with regard to the fate
of the towns and areas that have been threatened and besieged in the Republic
of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This resolution also reaffirms the inadmissibility
S/PV.3208
19-20
(Mr, Erdos, Hungary)
of any acquisition of territory by force. Hungary believes that the
resolution we have just adopted can be seen, on the one hand, as part of the
process of implementation of the Vance-Owen plan, a plan whose implementation
is still our basic objective, and, on the other, as a follow-up on the
preventive diplomacy efforts which are of crucial importance in today's world.
We hope that the towns and villages mentioned in the resolution -
Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zepa, Gorazde and other areas - will not meet the same fate
as so many other cities and villages in Bosnia and Herzegovina and will be
"saved from destruction and ""ethnic cleansing"". In the light of the alarming"
news coming to us from the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and especially
from Zepa, the Council must constantly remain on guard and must remain
prepared, if need be, to consider immediately the necessary steps to ensure
implementation of resolution 824 (1993).
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Russian): I thank the
representative of Hungary for the kind words he addressed to me.
Mr, ARRIA (Venezuela) (interpretation from Spanish): I am very
pleased to join in the congratulations that have been extended to you, Sir, by
my colleagues. My delegation will remain at your disposal throughout this
month, which is beginning to look like a very complex one indeed. We should
like to reiterate our admiration and respect to Ambassador Marker of Pakistan
and to his delegation for the extraordinary leadership they provided this past
April.
My country is a friend of Sri Lanka, and we would also like to join in
the expressions of sympathy that have been offered to the family of the
President and the people o:: that country.
S/PV.3208
21
(Mr, Arria, Venezuela)
Venezuela had the privilege to act as coordinator of the mission sent by
the Security Council to the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 28 April.
In this light we are especially pleased that the report submitted by our
mission to the Council has been incorporated into this resolution and that
today the Council has begun to act on some of its recommendations, in
particular those pertaining to the declaration of safe areas.
The resolution just adopted is akin to resolution 819 (1993), which
declared the city of Srebrenica a safe area. By its timeliness, that
resolution prevented the massacre of the people of Srebrenica, who have lived
and suffered under siege for more than a yearL Today's resolution is aimed at
anticipating the same kind of extreme situation as that experienced by the
people of Srebrenica, where conditions still do not exist for it to be
considered a safe area, as was the intention of the Security Council.
Today I can affirm that, after our visit, the city of Srebrenica remains
a sort of open jail, subjected to the effective control of Serbian
paramilitary forces, which keep it at their mercy, controlling and obstructing
the provision of essential services such as water, electricity and medical
attention. In this regard we reiterate - lest it be forgotten - that these
acts constitute crimes of genocide for which, some day, those responsible will
have to answer.
Only the presence in Srebrenica of the noble and brave Canadian battalion
separates its people from greater tragedy. My delegation once again voices
appreciation for that battalion and the personnel of the United Nations
Protection Force, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Committee of the Red Cross, who in the
most perilous conditions are making extraordinary efforts in that
long-suffering community.
S/PV.3208
22
(Mr. Arria, Venezuela)
The information coming out of UNHCR indicates that disease in
Srebrenica - a city that we have designated a safe area - continues to spread,
"especially among its children, in what our report refers to as a ""slow-motion"
"process of genocide"". (S/25700, para, 19)"
Without the slightest doubt, the situation in these cities, under attack
and siege by Serbian paramilitary forces for a year, casts a shadow on the
political will and credibility of this Council. Today we have limited
ourselves to a political and moral declaration centred on humanitarian
aspects.
There seems, however, to be no doubt that the international community
still faces even greater challenges and provocations that will demand
farther-reaching action than what the Security Council is today able to adopt
and, above all, implement. Nor is there any doubt that the Council will have
to exert every possible effort to make all of the former Yugoslavia a safe
area.
This is the responsibility of the international community, and especially
of the permanent members of the Security Council, which are called upon to
contribute extraordinary efforts and resources and, of course, enormous
sacrifices for a solution to this horrible conflict. According to our
Charter, that is the reponsibility of the great nations, whose actions are
especially appreciated and valued by my delegation.
We, the non-permanent members of the Security Council, in solidarity with
the cause of countries such as the former Yugoslavia, whose rights have been
so dreadfully trampled on, support the full implementation of this Council's
decisions.
S/PV.3208
23
(Mr, Arria, Venezuela)
Finally, we wish - as Ambassador Madeline Albright, representative of the
United States, said so aptly - that we were meeting today to adopt a
"resolution to start the implementation of a peace plan; but the Serbian"
party's intolerance and its disrespect for the international community has
once again stood in the way.
It is clear that it is now up to the international community to make the
appropriate response to this decision.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Russian): I thank the
representative of Venezuela for the kind words he addressed to me.
Mr, O'BRIEN (New Zealand): Congratulations, Mr. President, on
assuming the helm of this Council. I am confident that this ship is in good
hands this month. My heartiest congratulations go also to my neighbour, the
Permanent Representative of Pakistan, who conducted the Council's
deliberations with exemplary distinction last month.
As others have remarked, this resolution has its origins in the mission
that the Security Council sent to Bosnia 10 days ago. The decision we have
taken here illustrates, I think, the usefulness of such missions, which give
the Council some better insight into the complexity and challenge that
confront our Organization in the area of former Yugoslavia in these times.
New Zealand was privileged to be represented on the mission.
However, the measures endorsed in this resolution are in no sense a
complete answer to the suffering and outrageous acts that are occurring,
especially, but not only, in eastern Bosnia. They are intended, none the
less, to send a direct, unambiguous political message: that the well-being
and safety of populations in the regions concerned are and will remain a
legitimate concern of the Council. New Zealand calls upon the Bosnian Serbs
S/PV.3208
24
(Mr, O'Brien, New Zealand)
to take very careful heed of the present decisions of the Council and to
implement and observe the safe areas forthwith in the places enumerated in the
resolution.
This resolution is one which we expect will stand alongside other
decisions that the Council will take shortly in response to the outcome of the
Athens meeting of last weekend and the totally unacceptable and cynical
reaction to the outcome of that meeting by the Bosnian Serbs. The Council
must not now relent in its pursuit of peace and stability in Bosnia.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Russian): I thank the
representative of New Zealand for the kind words he addressed to me.
I shall now make a statement in my capacity as representative of the
Russian Federation.
The Russian Federation is deeply concerned over reports of continuing
hostilities in various parts of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The
report of the Security Council mission that recently visited that Republic
sheds further light on the tragic situation that has come about there,
especially in the humanitarian sphere. The report clearly shows that the
continuing cruel war has brought untold suffering to the civilian population
of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Russian leaders have repeatedly said that there is no alternative to the
Vance-Owen plan and have pointed out that any party to the conflict that does
not adopt it bears heavy responsibility for not doing so. I should like to
recall the statement of the President of the Russian Federation,
Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, on 27 April of this year, which emphasized that,
S/PV.3208
25
(The President)
"""Russia will not condone those who defy the world community. The Serbian"
nationalists and any ether parties to the conflict relying on force will
"meet with the stern rebuff of the United Nations."""
We proceed from the premise that now, after the talks in Athens, there
should be no further obstacles to the implementation of the Vance-Owen plan.
If this plan is not adopted and carried out, we are prepared to discuss
further, harsher steps. In this connection, no steps have been
pre-determined, nor have any been excluded from discussion.
S/PV.3208
26
(The President)
In the present circumstances, an end must be put immediately to any
attempts to attain further territorial gains by military force, to any actions
that result in suffering for the Bosnian people and in violations of
humanitarian law. The Security Council must send a clear signal to all the
parties to the Bosnian conflict that such activities are inadmissible.
In this connection, we believe that the decisions adopted by the Security
Council on Srebrenica have turned out to be positive steps that have saved the
lives of hundreds of Bosnians.
The Russian Federation, on the basis of its policy of principle in this
regard, supports the creation of additional safe areas in the territory of
Bosnia and Herzegovina. In fact, that is why we voted in favour of the draft
resolution in document S/25722. We believe that the creation of safe areas,
with the presence there of United Nations personnel, will help to improve the
humanitarian situation in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and to
achieve a peaceful settlement in that long-suffering country.
I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.
There are no other names on the list of speakers. The Security Council
has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The meeting rose,at 6.30 p.m.
