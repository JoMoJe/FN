ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
The agenda was adopted.
THE SITUATION PREVAILING IN AND ADJACENT TO THE UNITED NATIONS PROTECTED AREAS
IN CROATIA
LETTER DATED 25 JANUARY 1993 FROM THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE OF FRANCE
TO THE UNITED NATIONS ADDRESSED TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL
(S/25156)
The PRESIDENT: The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in response to the request contained in a
letter dated 25 January 1993 from the Permanent Representative of France to
the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council
(S/25156).
Members of the Council have before them document S/25160, which contains
the text of a draft resolution prepared in the course of the Council's prior
consultations.
Members of the Council have also received photocopies of letters dated
24 and 25 Janury 1993 from the Charge d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission
of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to the United Nations and from the
Permanent Representative of Croatia to the United Nations addressed to the
President of the Security Council, which will be issued as documents of the
Security Council under the symbols S/25154 and S/25159, respectively.
I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to the
following revision to the draft resolution, in its provisional form, contained
in document S/25160. Operative paragraph 4 should read as follows:
S/PV.3163
3
(The President)
"""4. Demands that all parties and others concerned comply strictly"
with the cease-fire arrangements already agreed and cooperate fully and
unconditionally in the implementation of the United Nations peace-keeping
plan (S/23280, Annex III), including the disbanding and demobilization of
"the Serb territorial defence units or other units of similar function;""."
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to the vote
on the draft resolution before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall take
it that that is the case.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
Before putting the draft resolution to the vote, I shall call on those
members of the Council who wish to make statements before the voting.
Mr, MERIMEE (France) (interpretation from French): This morning my
Government requested that the Security Council meet immediately to consider
the situation created by the attack by the Croatian Army in the region of
Maslenica, at a particularly important point in the ongoing peace process in
Geneva. This offensive, which has cost the lives of two French soldiers of
the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Croatia, can only further
jeaopardize the implementation of the United Nations peace plan in that region.
In the circumstances, it was very important that the Security Council
react today to these events, condemn these deliberate attacks against UNPROFOR
and demand the cessation of military activites by the Croatian Army directed
against UNPROFOR in the United Nations protected areas.
My delegation particularly wanted the Council to express its solemn
condolences to the families of the soldiers who have lost their lives as a
result of actions while they were carrying out their tasks in an increasingly
exposed environment. My Government is very pleased that the Council is
S/PV.3163
4 -
(Mr. Merimee, France)
demanding that the parties respect the safety of United Nations personnel and
that it is inviting the Secretary-General to take all necessary steps to
ensure their safety. This fundamental obligation is, unfortunately, too often
disregarded by parties involved in conflicts, but it is one to which our
Organization should scrupulously attend. This concern is shared by the
"Secretary-General, as he has made manifest in his report ""An Agenda for Peace""."
It is no less important that the Council calls upon the parties to
cooperate with UNPROFOR to resolve questions related to the implementation of
the United Nations peace plan and that it calls upon them to refrain from any
action or threat that might undermine current efforts for peace in Geneva.
In the territory of the former Yugoslavia, the United Nations is involved
in a complex, cumbersome, difficult and dangerous operation. Peace in what is
historically one of the most sensitive regions in Europe is at stake. France
has spared neither its resources nor its personnel, and 11 French soldiers
have already died in the service of UNPROFOR. My country will continue to do
what it believes to be its duty in order tirelessly to promote, within the
framework of our Organization, the chances for peace.
The PRESIDENT: I shall now put to the vote the draft resolution
contained in document S/25160, as orally revised in its provisional form.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In.favour:	Brazil, Cape Verde, China, Djibouti, France, Hungary, Japan,
Morocco, New Zealand, Pakistan, Russian Federation, Spain,
United Kingdom of Great Britatin and Northern Ireland,
United States of America, Venezuela

The PRESIDENT:;There were 15 votes in favour. The draft
resolution, as orally revised in its provisional form, has been adopted
unanimously as resolution 802 (1993).
I shall now call on those members of the Council who wish to make
statements following the voting.

Mr. VORONTSOV (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian):
The Russian Federation is seriously concerned by the military operations of
the Croatian Army in the Serbian Krajina region. This action has been taken
at a moment when the possibility of settling the conflict in Bosnia and
Herzegovina had become quite feasible.
This is an extremely ill-considered step which has become yet another
link in the chain of violations by Zagreb of the demands of the United Nations
Security Council. The Croatian attack on the United Nations Protection Force
(UNPROFOR) deserves the harshest condemnation by the Council. We also express
our sympathy to the families of the French members of UNPROFOR who have been
killed.
For a long time now, the Croatian side has been ignoring the ban on
flights over the air space of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and has been shipping
arms into that Republic. Croatian units are conducting military operations
against the Muslims in Bosnia. The attack now taking place by Croatian armed
forces in the areas under United Nations protection is a direct challenge to
the peacemaking mission of the United Nations in the former Yugoslavia. The
present attempt by the Croatian leadership to resolve the problem of Krajina
by military means is all the more regrettable in that the leaders of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and of Croatia were recently, to all
appearances, close to achieving a mutually acceptable agreement.
We are particularly disturbed by the fact that Croatia is ignoring the
demands of the Security Council and the Croatian Army is continuing its
offensive actions in Serb-populated areas of Croatia. Zagreb is not only
refusing to restore the status quo and withdraw from the territories it has
seized through invasion, but indeed is seeking to extend the area in which it
S/PV.3163

(Mr. Vorontsov, Russian Federation)
is carrying out military actions. The Croatian side is engaged in armed
actions in the eastern sector too, where a Russian battalion of UNPROFOR is
located, and that battalion has also suffered losses. It is clear that the
Croatian attack is not only in itself a gross violation of any number of
Security Council resolutions, but is also endangering the Geneva negotiations
for a peaceful settlement in the former Yugoslavia, which are now at an
extremely crucial and sensitive stage.
Having taken all these factors into account, the delegation of the
Russian Federation voted for the draft resolution prepared in the Security
Council. However, it is perfectly obvious that, in the event that the
Croatian side does not meet the demands in this and other relevant resolutions
of the Security Council, sanctions will have to be imposed on Croatia to the
same extent as those imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The
Security Council must do its utmost to avert a new and exceedingly dangerous
spiral of escalation in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia.
The PRESIDENT: The Security Council has thus concluded the present
stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.
The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.
The meeting rose at 7.50 p.m.
