ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
The agenda was adopted.
THE SITUATION PREVAILING IN AND ADJACENT TO THE UNITED NATIONS PROTECTED AREAS
"IN CROATIA	;"
The PRESIDENT: The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.
Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have
been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:
"""The Security Council has heard with deep concern the report from"
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for the Former
Yugoslavia on the situation in and around the United Nations Protected
Areas (UNPAs) in the Republic of Croatia and in particular in respect of
the Maslenica crossing.
"""The Security Council reaffirms the presidential statement of"
15 July 1993 (S/26084). Following this statement, the parties reached an
agreement on 15 and 16 July 1993 at Erdut which requires the withdrawal
of Croatian armed forces and police from the area of the Maslenica bridge
by 31 July 1993 and the placing of the bridge under the exclusive control
of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR).
"""The Security Council demands that the Croatian forces withdraw"
forthwith in conformity with the above-mentioned agreement, and that they
permit the immediate deployment of UNPROFOR. The Council also demands
that the Krajina Serb forces refrain form entering the area. The Council
calls for maximum restraint from all parties, including the observance of
a cease-fire.
