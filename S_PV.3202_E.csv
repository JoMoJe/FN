addressed to the Secretary-General.
The first speaker is the representative of Bulgaria. I invite him to
take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr. PASHOVSKI (Bulgaria): First allow me to congratulate you. Sir,
on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of
April and to express our appreciation of your capable guidance of the
Council's work.
S/PV.3202
6
(Mr, Pashovski, Bulgaria)
The Security Council is meeting to consider the situation in Bosnia and
Herzegovina - a situation which represents one of the gravest challenges to
the world community today. A full-scale war is still raging in that country
taking tens of thousands of human lives, driving millions of people away from
their homes and causing tremendous destruction and human tragedy. It is
undoubtedly the ugliest conflict that Europe has witnessed since the Second
World War with gross and massive violations of human rights, disregard for the
"most sacred human values and the abhorrent ""ethnic cleansing"" targeted at"
innocent civilians. The latest, and some of the most shocking examples of
these atrocious practices, are the events in Eastern Bosnia and, in
particular, the attacks on Srebrenica.
Other alarming aspect of the conflict are the numerous cases of totally
unacceptable defiance of the humanitarian efforts of the United Nations and
various international agencies and the obstruction of the efforts of the
United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in carrying out its mandate. I
would like to take this opportunity to express my Government's highest
appreciation for the brave and commendable performance of UNPROFOR's military
and civilian personnel under extremely difficult conditions.
The world community cannot and should not tolerate any more these clear
and continuous violations of the United Nations Charter - of the fundamental
principles of international law. The entire international legal system
established during the post-war period is being jeopardized in all its
dimensions - political, security, humanitarian and economic. If not resolved
without delay, the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina may spread to other parts of
former Yugoslavia and beyond, thus endangering regional peace and security in
the Balkans, as well as stability in Europe. The Security Council should, as
a matter of priority, consider the need for stepping-up effective preventive
S/PV.3202
7
(Mr, Pashovski, Bulgaria)
actions to contain a possible spillover to Macedonia and Kosovo. New waves of
i
refugees will emerge and new atrocities will be committed. We are gravely
concerned by this possibility.
Since the beginning of the conflict in former Yugoslavia, Bulgaria has
been advocating the search for a peaceful solution based on internationally
recognized principles and norms. We fully support all relevant Security
Council resolutions and remain committed to their implementation. The focus
of the international community now should be on bringing the Bosnian Serb side
to accept the Vance-Owen plan in its entirety as the only feasible option for
ending the bloodshed and providing a lasting solution to the conflict. There
is an immediate need for stepping up international pressure by undertaking
appropriate actions to ensure full implementation of all Security Council
decisions.
Bulgaria stands firmly behind the principles of international law, human
rights and democracy. It should be stressed that in supporting the resolve to
put an end to the conflict, we are confronting not the Serbian people but,
"rather, those who have chosen ""ethnic cleansing"" and other inhuman practices"
to achieve their selfish political goals. The Serbian people should see
through this phenomenon and realize that it is unacceptable to and resolutely
"rejected by the international community. ’	;"
Decisive action is necessary without delay. We have repeatedly stated
our support for efforts in this regard. Given the geo-political and
historical realities of the Balkans, however, we reiterate our principled
position that Bulgaria will not intervene in the conflict with any form of
armed force and that maintenance of security and stability in the region makes
it imperative that all other Balkan States assume and pursue the same
commitment.
S/PV.3202
8
(Mr. Pashovski, Bulgaria)
Bulgaria stands firmly behind the measures taken by the Security Council
aimed at promoting a speedy peaceful solution through political and economic
means. We, therefore, support the adoption of resolution 820 (1993) and state
our readiness strictly to implemement its provisions. At the- same time, we
appeal to those who made the adoption of such harsh measures unavoidable to
reconsider their policies and show a sense of responsibility for the future of
their own people.
Bulgaria has been strict in fulfilling its responsibility for
implementing the sanctions imposed by the Security Council. What is more, we
have demonstrated and proved in practice our goodwill for cooperation in the
efforts to ensure their effectiveness. The Bulgarian Government acts in close
coordination and in collective efforts with the nations of the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), the European Community and the
Western European Union. Tn meeting our share of .he responsibility for
ensuring implementation, we are motivated by the understanding that sanctions
are one of the means of achieving a settlement.
At the same time it should be underscored that Bulgaria, among the
countries bordering Serbia and Montenegro, is the one most affected by the
implementation of economic sanctions. The provisions of resolution
820 (1993), when put into effect, will almost totally cut Bulgaria's
transportation links with the rest of Europe. The application of the measures
will exact a very high price for us and we will ba put in an extremely
difficult situation if we are left to meet this price alone. We welcome the
establishment of a body to address the special economic problems arising from
the implementation of the sanctions and expect that it will devise a concrete
mechanism for assistance to the States most affected in overcoming their
S/PV.3202
9-10
(Mr. Pashovski, Bulgaria)
hardships. This mechanism should then be backed by the authority of the
Security Council through an appropriate decision.
Along with the possibility of rendering assistance and compensation for
losses, we are of the opinion that options such as foreign investments and
credits especially designated for infrastructure projects directly related to
the effect of relevant Security Council resolutions should also be
considered. Among such projects, the construction of a bridge on the Danube
river at Vidin/Calafat, a railroad between Sofia and Skopje and other motor
and railways projects could be identified. We believe that a meaningful
involvement of international financial institutions as well as other
multilateral and bilateral cooperation efforts are urgently required in this
respect.
The PRESIDENT: I thank the representative of Bulgaria for the kind
words addressed to my predecessor and to me.
The next speaker on my list is the representative of the United Arab
Emirates. I invite him to take a seat at the Council table and to make his
statement.
Mr. SAMHAN (United Arab Emirates) (interpretation from Arabic) : It
gives me pleasure on behalf of my delegation and on behalf of the States of
the Gulf Cooperation Council to express to you, Sir, and to your friendly
country, Pakistan, our sincere congratulations on your assumption of the
presidency of the Council for this month. We are fully confident that your
wide expertise in many international issues and, in particular, those relating
to international peace and security, will contribute to the achievement of
positive results that will benefit all of mankind.
S/PV.3202
11
(Mr, Samhan, United
Arab Emirates)
It gives me pleasure also to convey to your predecessor, His Excellency
Ambassador O'Brien, Permanent Representative of New Zealand, our sincere
thanks for the wisdom and efficiency with which he presided over the work of
the Council last month.
More than a year has passed since Serb irregular forces, morally,
politically and militarily supported by Serbia and Montenegro, commenced their
wanton aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in
contravention of the Charter of the United Nations and principles of
international humanitarian law and international legitimacy. The Security
Council and the General Assembly have adopted numerous resolutions in the hope
that these, most recently Security Council resolution 820 (1993), would stop
the aggression and settle the problem peacefully. But Serb forces have
"persisted in their aggression and their policy of ""ethnic cleansing"" and"
genocide in total disregard of those resolutions. The resolutions included no
deterrent measures, and this has led the Serb forces to continue their
aggression and their violations of the most basic principles of human rights.
In view of the present situation and the continued flagrant violation by
Serb forces of international legitimacy as embodied in Security Council
resolutions, it is now necessary that the Council adopt a deterrent approach
towards the aggressor and lift the arms embargo against the Republic of Bosnia
and Herzegovina, enabling it to exercise its soveieign right of self-defence.
The Council should heed international calls to find a peaceful solution to the
problem and to put an end to the wanton aggression against the Republic of
Bosnia and Herzegovina.
S/PV.3202
12
(Mr, Samhan, United
Arab Emirates)
At their meeting held on 4 and 5 April 1993 at Riyadh, the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia, the Foreign Ministers of the States members of the Gulf
Cooperation Council reiterated the position of the Governments of the Gulf
Cooperation Council on the situation in the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. They said that
"""The Council of Ministers strongly condemns Serb aggression against the"
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and calls on the Security Council to
take all necessary measures, including the lifting of the arms embargo
against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina enabling that State to
exercise its right to self-defence, and to make use of military force in
accordance with Chapter VII, Article 42, of the Charter in order to
restore international peace and security and compel the aggressor forces
to comply with resolutions of international legitimacy. The Council
should not permit the aggressor to be rewarded by allowing it to change
the demographic composition or achieve any territorial gains. It should
compel Serb forces to withdraw and respect the sovereignty and
"independence of the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina""."
Under the Charter the Security Council bears the primary responsibility
"for the maintenance of international peace and security; the permanent members"
bear a special responsibility in that regard. We join many other States in
believing that the Security Council has yet to take the measures necessary to
confront Serb aggression, but we think there is still time to do what is
needed.
S/PV.3202
13
(Mr, Samhan, United
Arab Emirates)
To solve the crisis, we are calling for resolutions that conform to the
Charter, the principles of international law, total respect for the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and the principle of the
peaceful settlement of disputes. They would reject the acquisition of the
territory of others by force and would not permit the aggressor to gain by its
aggression.
I wish finally to reiterate our firm belief in the role of the United
Nations, and particularly the Security Council, in the maintenance of
international peace and security. This is based on our deep conviction that
disputes must be settled by peaceful means and in accordance with the letter
and spirit of the United Nations Charter and the other basic principles
governing international relations. On that basis.- we believe that the
responsibility for maintaining peace, stability, security and peaceful
coexistence among peoples is a collective responsibility, and that the
Security Council has a primary role to play in that regard, and in particular
with respect to the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The PRESIDENT: I thank the representative of the United Arab
Emirates for the kind words he addressed to my predecessor and to me.
The next speaker is the representative of the Comoros. I invite him to
take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr. MOUMIN (Comoros): The delegation of the Federal Islamic
Republic of the Comoros joins delegations that haze spoken before it in
extending its warmest congratulations to you, Sir. on your assumption of the
S/PV.3202
14-15
(Mr. Moumin, Comoros)
presidency of the Council for the month of April. We are confident that the
Council, under your able guidance, will successfully carry out its
responsibilities.
My delegation would also like to thank Ambassador O'Brien, Permanent
Representative of New Zealand, for his remarkable stewardship of the Council
during the month of March.
My country's position on the aggression by Serbia and Montenegro against
the Muslim population of Bosnia and Herzegovina io well known to Council
members and to the general membership of the United Nations. Consequently we
do not intend to bore the Council with repetitions. But I must state that my
delegation speaks today with a very heavy heart, disappointed in ourselves for
our inability to help in any way to stop the brutal massacre of women,
children and innocent civilians of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Serbs'
barbarity and callous disregard for human life and the thought that this is
taking place in so-called civilized Europe make us quiver with disdain and
contempt for those who have always tried to give ac lessons on civilized
behaviour. Let us hope that after this they will acknowledge that
civilization and the values of human rights originated with us, and that they
have no lessons whatsoever to teach us.
S/PV.3202
16
(Mr, Moumin, Comoros)
As for this Organization, and particularly for this important organ
entrusted with the maintenance of international peace and security, can its
members, particularly its permanent members, in all honesty and in clear
conscience, look straight into the eyes of the 50,000 raped women of Bosnia
and Herzegovina and into the eyes of the children and parents and say they
have done all they could do to stop the savagery of the Serbs? And what about
the victims of Srebrenica, whose plight seems at last to have touched a nerve
in the conscience of the European capitals, as evidenced by a number of
statements in the Council yesterday and the adoption of resolution 820 (1993)
on 17 April. Can the Council explain why it took that much loss of life for
it to act?
Although the delegation of the Comoros welcomes resolution 820 (1993) on
the tightening of the economic sanctions against the aggressors, Serbia and
Montenegro, we are concerned that these sanctions, because of the insistence
of a permanent member, will not have the immediate effect of protecting the
Bosnian Muslims from continuing heavy Serbian bombardment of populated
civilian centres, particularly Sarajevo and Bihac, and will still leave
Bosnian Muslims vulnerable to Serbian attacks and interruptions of United
Nations relief supplies to other areas.
In a powerful, moving opinion published recently, a prominent European
commentator stated:
"""The unpunished aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina has put the"
"whole moral foundation of the United Nations into jeopardy."""
That is a very strong criticism of the Council and the United Nations. The
time has come for the Council to redeem itself and the United Nations and to
restore the confidence which the small and the weak have placed in this body.
The Council - your Council, Mr. President - has the moral obligation,
S/PV.3202
17
(Mr, Moumin, Comoros)
"after the recent despicable actions of ""ethnic cleansing"" by the Serbs in"
Srebrenica and their continued contempt for the international community, to
take, at minimum, the following measures by adopting, with immediate effect,
the Non-Aligned draft resolution, which should contain the following:
measures to place under effective United Nations control all the heavy
"weaponry of all sides; authorization for Members, individually or"
"collectively, to use force against those who refuse to lay down their arms;"
and immediate authorization for the lifting of the arms embargo imposed
against the victims of aggression, the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The
Council cannot do less than that. How could it, when even the most adamant
opponent of the use of force, the Co-Chairman of the Steering Committee of the
International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, Lord Owen, has come to the
same conclusion we reached long ago - that only the use of force can bring the
Serbs to the negotiating table?
As for the five permanent members of the Security Council, need we remind
you that the honour and privilege bestowed upon you by the founding fathers of
this Organization go hand in hand with responsiblity and sacrifice on your
part?
As for the Permanent Representatives of France and the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, your share of the responsibility cannot be
over-emphasized, and your countries' hesitation in taking courageous but
difficult political decisions is difficult to comprehend. However, the news
we hear from your respective capitals gives us reason to hope that it has at
last dawned on those who make decisions that the time for serious action has
"come. We welcome the change of attitude. As the English would say, ""Better"
"late than never."" Act now, before history judges you severely."
As for the Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation, we would
S/PV.3202
18
(Mr, Moumin, Comoros)
kindly remind you that your country, as one of the permanent members of the
Security Council, has an obligation to fulfil its international
responsibility, which in this case is the preservation of peace and security
in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a matter of top priority. The cold war is
over - gone - and with it has gone the time for protecting clients' interests,
particularly those of clients who are brutal aggressors and who have utter
disregard for civilized international norms. The English have a saying that
people are judged by the company they keep. I am sure the people of Russia do
not wish to be identified with people who practice mass rape of women and
small children for political goals, as the Serbs do. Your country should
avoid them as one would avoid a leper. Do not negate your international
responsibility for people who, I am sure, are not even .going to be grateful to
you for doing so. Do not become a defender of the unjust, lest you become
unjust yourselves. The international community is watching, and history will
judge your country's actions.
As for the Permanent Representative of the People's Republic of China, we
appreciate your country's consistent, principled position on the authorization
"of the use of force by individual Members; but we should like your country,"
because of the brutality and inhuman methods used by the Serbs in their
"practice of ""ethnic cleansing"", which is genocidal, to think again and"
consider what is happening to Bosnia and Herzegovina as an extreme case which
warrants your voting in favour of the authorization of the use of force and
the lifting of the arms embargo against the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
As for the only super-Power, the United States of America, we have this
to say to Madame Ambassador, who, we realize, is not here: religious
intolerance, persecution and bigotry are considered by its people - and
rightly so - to be immoral, because American society is formed of people who
S/PV.3202
19-20
(Mr, Moumin, Comoros)
themselves had once fled from such persecution. Many a time the American
people has sacrificed its loved ones in the defence of justice and just causes
and against oppression.
It has become clear, since the First World War, that without American
leadership nothing can be achieved. During the Second World War the
leadership of the United States helped Europe to get rid of nazism. It was
their leadership that defeated communism, and recently it was their leadership
role that helped to liberate Kuwait and protect the Kurds and the Shi'ites
from Saddam Hussein.
A few months ago the people of Somalia were dying daily of hunger by the
hundreds, while food was available but could not be delivered to those in
need. The international community watched helplessly while the warlords in
Somalia terrorized their own people. Few countries were willing to send in
forces to help secure food for the suffering people of Somalia, but once the
United States took the courageous, commendable political decision to do
something about the situation, everything changed for the better. A number of
countries that were unwilling to provide forces have now joined in the peace-
keeping efforts. Once again American leadership has acted as an important
catalyst.
America needs to stand firm on its principles. Your country, Madame
Ambassador, must take the lead by using all means necessary to stop Serbian
aggression against the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Decisive action is
needed to prevent further crimes of genocide by the Serbs against the Muslims
of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Remember: without Bosnian Muslims there is no
Bosnia and Herzegovina. We should add that the preservation of Bosnia and
Herzegovina is a vital prerequisite for stabilty and peace in the Balkans and,
in the final analysis, in the larger area of Europe as a whole.
S/PV.3202
21
(Mr, Moumin, Comoros)
During the presidential campaign in the United States, peace-loving
peoples all over the world, and in particular we of the Islamic Ummah, were
very encouraged by President Clinton's firm stand on the question of Bosnia
"and Herzegovina; also, the recent call by the leaders of both parties in the"
United States Senate for tl)e selective use of force has given us cause to
believe that the Administration will once again take up its leadership role
and is ready to fulfil its international responsibility. The United States
did so to save Kuwait, and it can do it to save Bosnia and Herzegovina. By
doing so it will eliminate the perception of double standards and lend
credibility to the concept of the new world order, which is, after all, an
American concept.
The American people cannot afford to be indifferent to nor tolerate the
"mass rape of women, the maiming of small children and the crime of ""ethnic"
"cleansing"". To do so would be un-American. Now that the Europeans have had a"
welcome change of heart, we of the international community are eagerly waiting
for the United States to act with determination.
Concerning the caucus of non-aligned members of the Security Council, we
have nothing but praise and gratitude for them. We are proud of them for
their steadfastness. We support their draft resolution and call upon the
Council to adopt it, with the amendments we have suggested.
We thank the other non-permanent members of the Security Council for
their consistent support for the causes of the weak.
We cannot conclude our statement without touching upon the peace process
undertaken on behalf of the international communi :y by the two Co-Chairmen of
the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the Former
"Yugoslavia, Lord Owen and Secretary Vance; I must say that we in the Comoros,"
S/PV.3202
22
(Mr. Moumin, Comoros)
while not liking the peace plan very much and recognizing its significant
shortcomings, like many others accept the view the Secretary-General expressed
in his report that:
"""The Co-Chairmen's peace package provides the only mechanism"
available for the re-establishment of peace, with justice and respect for
"human rights, in Bosnia and Herzegovina"". (S/25479, para, 30)"
We applaud the two parties that have signed it despite its manifest
disadvantages for their peoples.
The PRESIDENT: I thank the representative of the Comoros for his
kind words addressed to my predecessor and to me.
The next speaker is the representative of Egypt. I invite him to take a
place at the Council table and to make his statement.
_..............
Mr. ELARABY (Egypt.)-- ('interpretation from Arabic): Allow me at the
outset, Mr. President, to express our deep gratitude for the efforts that you
have been making since you became President of the Council. Your wisdom and
diplomatic skill will bear fruit and make it possible for the Council to
shoulder its responsibilities and cope with international crises this month.
I should also like to thank your predecessor, Ambassador Terence O'Brien,
Permanent Representative of New Zealand, for the efforts he made as President
of the Council last month.
The tragic developments unfolding in the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina have set the Security Council a very particular problem that could
create a very serious historical precedent with consequences above and beyond
the present conflict. An independent and sovereign State, a Member of the
United Nations, has been subjected to military aggression and is even being
threatened with gradual disappearance in the full view of the world while the
SZPV.3202
23
(Mr, Elaraby, Egypt)
Security Council, the body principally responsible for maintaining
international peace and security, finds itself powerless to stop this
historical tragedy.
It is the credibility of the entire United Nations that is at stake
"today; history will pass a heavy judgement on us all, most particularly on the"
great Powers that are permanent members of the Security Council and that do
have the military means to put an end to the massacres that are being
perpetrated each day, if the Council does not discharge its responsibilities.
The Egyptian delegation is alarmed by the situation prevailing in Bosnia
and Herzegovina. Over the past 12 months there have been thousands of
innocent victims, and my delegation wishes, first and foremost, to stop the
bloodshed and put an end to the atrocious crimes being perpetrated against
unarmed civilians who lack the means to defend thai. selves. Given this
situation, we request the Security Council to deal with this tragedy with
determination and without ambiguity and adopt, immediately, a binding cease-
fire resolution for the whole of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We also ask that the
aggressor respect the Council's resolution or face the implementation of all
the steps provided for under Chapter VII of the Charter.
The Security Council has already adopted many resolutions on the
worsening situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and, as we are all aware, none
of these resolutions has been implemented and none of them has proved
sufficient: the Serbian aggression has continued despite them. The time has
now come for the Council to send a strong, determined message to Serbia and
Montenegro and to the Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegc/ina stating that the
international community has lost patience with them because of their challenge
to these international resolutions and because they are continuing their
S/PV.3202
24-25
(Mr, Elaraby, Egypt)
savage aggression against the territory and the people of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. The international community cannot tolerate more acts of
aggression that would enable the Serbs to present us with a new fait accompli
in order to achieve their goal of regional expansionism.
The only way to deal with this problem is for the Security Council to
adopt a strong, clear resolution that would include taking the measures
provided for by the Charter so that the aggressor is confronted, the
aggression is eliminated and reparations are awarded to the victim, which is a
State Member of this international Organization. That is the price that must
be paid for international Law to be applied equitably and without
discrimination throughout the world.
S/PV.3202
26
(Mr, Elarabv, Egypt)
The delegation of Egypt is aware of the complexity of this problem, but
we believe it will be possible to achieve a political settlement in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, particularly since President Izetbegovic has answered the
international community's appeal and has signed the peace plan proposed by the
co-Chairmen of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia.
The situation is now clear to the international community. Despite the
fact that the peace plan splits up Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Bosnian Muslim
party has respected all its international obligations with a view to the
implementation of the plan. That is why the Security Council should not wait
any longer and go on hoping that the Serbian party will sign the peace plan,
which would allow it to gain time, particularly since the situation on the
ground brooks no further delay.
Hence, the Security Council should immediately adopt a binding
resolution, in keeping with its powers, that would oblige all the parties to
respect the peace plan and to take all the measures necessary to guarantee its
implementation.
The events in Bosnia and Herzegovina are placing the international order
in a contradictory position. At the very time when the world is calling for
respect for human rights and placing them at the top of international
priorities, at the very time when we are getting ready, at the dawn of the
twenty-first century, to adopt a new declaration of human rights, we are
witnessing in Bosnia and Herzegovina the most odious violations of human
rights and international humanitarian law. Many reports from international
bodies contain details concerning massacres of Muslims, details concerning
persons who have been burned alive, details concerning attacks on old people
and children, of mass rapes of Muslim women. There have been other practices
S/PV.3202
27
(Mr, Elarabv, Egypt)
that have not yet been revealed and that are even worse than what the Nazis
"called the ""final solution""."
The Egyptian delegation wonders why we should wait any longer. Are there
double standards? The world does not need additional proof that the Serbs are
"using every possible means to exterminate the Muslims and to practise ""ethnic"
"cleansing"" in that region - which will be a black page in the history of the"
twentieth century, now nearing its end, despite all that has been achieved.
Recently the International Court of Justice issued an opinion against the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). In that opinion it
asked Serbia and Montenegro to take immediate measures to put an end to the
genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Security Council took note of that
opinion by the International Court of Justice, and the international community
expects the Council to shoulder its responsibilities under the Charter for the
maintenance of international law. The Council must safeguard the
international Organization's prestige and credibility and demonstrate to the
world that respect for human rights is really the very first international
priority at present.
In the light of all I have said, the Security Council must immediately
review all its resolutions that have not yet been implemented. Instead of
having recourse to such long-term measures as sanctions - which on many
occasions have proved to be futile in ensuring the achievement of the desired
goals - the Council should take such other measures as the establishment of an
immediate cease-fire in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the lifting of the arms
embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina, the placing of heavy weapons under
international control, the withdrawal of Serbian forces from the territories
occupied by force, and aerial attacks against certain Serbian targets that
S/PV.3202
28
(Mr, Elaraby, Egypt)
serve as a support base for the Serbians. The Council should also demand that
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia stop its support for the Bosnian Serbs so
that their military arsenal will be prevented from pursuing the aggression.
Furthermore, the United Nations should deploy international observers on the
borders between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia. In accordance with resolution 787 (1992), effective measures
"should be taken immediately to put an end to the practice of ""ethnic"
"cleansing"". First, total international control should be imposed in order to"
ensure that an end is put to the expulsions of Muslim inhabitants resulting
from Serbian intimidation, torture, rape and other practices. Secondly,
binding international measures should be taken to guarantee the return of
"those who have been expelled under the pretext of ""ethnic cleansing"" and to"
oblige the Serbian authorities to give compensation. Thirdly, those who are
responsible for these practices should be brought to justice before an
international tribunal - namely, the war crimes tribunal established by the
"United Nations; we should not accept the argument that these guilty persons"
were merely carrying out orders. Fourthly, effective machinery should be
established to ensure the effective implementation of the relevant United
Nations resolutions.
The delegation of Egypt is in favour of the application of Chapter VII of
the Charter to deal with the aggressor and force it to respect international
law.
Like other Members of the United Nations, Egypt is furnishing military
units to the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. But there is no justification for using the safety of that Force
as a pretext for failing to apply the collective security measures provided
for in the Charter.
S/PV.3202
29-30
(Mr, Elaraby, Egypt)
The delegation of Egypt is presenting its views to the Security Council
as a member of the Contact Group established by the Organization of the
Islamic Conference to follow up the present situation and hopes that the
Council will take them into consideration and will take effective measures
immediately to put an end to the tragedy in Bosnia and Herzegovina decisively,
comprehensively and urgently. Half-measures are no longer acceptable.
The Security Council must shoulder its responsibilities. If it does not
do that, it must admit that it is impotent and allow the General Assembly to
hold an emergency session to consider the worsening situation in Bosnia and
Herzegovina and take the initiative of calling on the international community
to provide all the necessary assistance to enable Bosnia and Herzegovina, a
State Member of the United Nations, to exercise fully its right to
self-defence in accordance with Article 21 of the Charter of the United
Nations.
The PRESIDENT: I thank the representative of Egypt for the kind
words he addressed to my predecessor and to me.
The next speaker is the representative of Ukraine. I invite him to take
a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
S/PV.3202

Mr, BAT IOUK (Ukraine): Allow me first of all to congratulate you,
Sir, on your assumption of the high office of President of the Security
Council for the month of April and to express the conviction of the delegation
of Ukraine that your able leadership will bring the present deliberations to a
successful conclusion. I should also like to express our appreciation to your
predecessor, Ambassador O'Brien, for the exemplary manner in which he
conducted the work of the Security Council during the previous month.
Recent tragic events in Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially in the eastern
part of the country, and the continuing escalation of fighting between all
parties to the conflict, resulting in unspeakable bloodshed and the suffering
of the civilian population, have once again highlighted an urgent need for a
speedy settlement of the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We are facing a
real threat of the geographical boundaries of the conflict widening beyond
Bosnia and Herzegovina and the possibility of the involvement of other
countries or even groups of countries in it. The senseless continuation of
the fighting threatens European stability and undermines an historic
opportunity to build up a sound post-war security structure in the world.
The Security Council has steadily toughened international response to the
defiant stand of those parties to the conflict which have ignored friendly
advice and timely warnings. Resolution after resolution has brought new
sanctions, and the adoption of Security Council resolution 820 (1993) should
be viewed as a logical consequence of this process. Everyone must realize
that the international community will continue to mount pressure on those
responsible for the continuation of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina until
the ultimate goals of peace and the restoration of respect for human and
national rights in that region are achieved.
S/PV.3202
32
(Mr. Batiouk, Ukraine)
In the view of Ukraine, peace in that region can be achieved on the basis
of the principles of respect for the political independence and sovereignty of
"the internationally recognized State of Bosnia and Herzegovina;"
"non-interference in its internal affairs; respect by all neighbouring States"
"of its territorial integrity; the strict observance by all parties to the"
"conflict of human rights and the rights of national minorities; the negotiated"
"settlement of disputes among ethnic groups by peaceful political means; and"
the non-recognition of all territorial changes as a result of the use of
force.
All the principles I have mentioned are reflected in the comprehensive
peace plan presented by the Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the
International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia. Ukraine welcomes the fact
that this plan has now been accepted in full by two of the Bosnian parties.
Simultaneously, we express our grave concern at the refusal of the Bosnian
Serb party so far to accept the peace plan in full, including the provisional
provincial map. In our opinion, an additional effort on the part of the
international community should be made in order to renew the negotiation
process among all Bosnian parties under the auspices of the United Nations,
aimed at bringing about a solution acceptable to ill.
Ukraine is deeply concerned by the deterioration of the humanitarian
situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially in Srebrenica, and alarmed at
the fate of thousands of civilians, including women and children, who are
trapped in the town without food, medical assistance or essential services.
It is unacceptable that parties to the conflict link humanitarian, issues to
their broader political goals and prevent the humanitarian convoys from
reaching the needy population. We support the demand formulated in Security
S/PV.3202
33
(Mr, Batiouk, Ukraine)
Council resolution 819 (1993) for the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian
assistance to all parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina and agree that any
impediment to the delivery of humanitarian assistance constitutes a serious
violation of international humanitarian law.
The delegation of Ukraine would also like to stress the indispensable
role of the United Nations peace-keeping force in Bosnia and Herzegovina in
delivering humanitarian aid to the civilian population. We commend the
courage and dedication of the Blue Helmets in carrying out this noble mission,
and among them the Ukrainian battalion in Sarajevo, which has suffered heavy
losses, including four servicemen killed, the last on 16 April. It is yet
another reminder that the international community should elaborate without
delay effective, legally binding measures to ensure the safety of the peace-
keeping and other personnel and bring those responsible for deliberate attacks
against peace-keepers to justice.
In the view of the Ukrainian delegation, enforcement measures taken so
far by the Security Council against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia
and Montenegro) are designed to bring about a speedy solution to the crisis in
that region. As was noted in a letter from the President of Ukraine,
Mr. Leonid Kravchuk, to the Secretary-General on 22 March 1993:
"""Ukraine considers the United Nations sanctions to be an integral"
part of the international efforts towards the peaceful settlement of the
crisis in the former fugoslavia and confirms its resolve strictly to
"observe them."""
At the same time, it is incumbent upon the Security Council to adopt
measures to mitigate the negative consequences of the sanctions for those
States which not only comply with them but are also entrusted with the task of
S/PV.3202
34
(Mr. Batiouk, Ukraine)
the ensuring the enforcement of the sanctions regime imposed by the Security
Council. To illustrate the magnitude of the problem for Ukraine, I should
like to cite just one example. As a result of the sanctions and the
disruption of shipping on the Danube river, one of the major shipping
companies of Ukraine, the Danube Shipping company, with assets of $2 billion,
is on the verge of economic collapse. This means that 25,000 workers may lose
their jobs, leaving more than 100,000 dependents without any means of
subsistence.
We believe that the time has come, especially after the adoption of
resolution 820 (1993), to find practical ways of implementing Article 50 of
the United Nations Charter. It is our conviction that such a decision would
make sanctions an effective instrument available to the Security Council
enjoying the support of the international community as a whole. In this
connection, the delegation of Ukraine welcomes the establishment of the
Working Group within the Committee on sanctions against Yugoslavia to deal
with these issues.
It is also important that the new guidelines to be elaborated by the
Committee on sanctions include procedures that would not be unfairly harmful
to third countries. We have to remember that Security Council sanctions are
directed against a specific State or States, and other countries of the region
must not be the eventual or unintentional targets of enforcement measures.
This requires very close cooperation between the Committee and regional
arrangements, including sanctions assistance missions.
In conclusion, the delegation of Ukraine would like to emphasize that all
parties concerned must realize that no solution to the Bosnian problem can be
reached on the battlefield. The only viable peace can be achieved at the
S/PV.3202
35
(Mr, Batiouk, Ukraine)
negotiating table. With this in mind, the international community should
continue to use all relevant United Nations mechanisms provided in the Charter
in order to put an end to the current state of wa:.' in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The PRESIDENT: 1 thank the representative of Ukraine for his kind
words addressed to my predecessor and me.
In view of the lateness of the hour, I intend to adjourn the meeting
now. With the concurrence of the members of the Council, the next meeting of
the Security Council to continue the consideration of the item on the agenda,
will take place this afternoon, Tuesday, 20 April 1993, at 3:00 p.m. sharp.
The meeting rose at 1:00 p.m.
