"The..PRESIDENT; The Security Council will now begin its"
consideration of the item on the agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in response to the requests contained in
letters dated 3 March 1993 from the Permanent Representatives of the United
States of America and Bosnia and Herzegovina to the United Nations addressed
to the President of the Security Council, documents S/25353 and S/25358,
respectively.
Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have
been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:
"""The Security Council, recalling all its relevant resolutions and"
statements, expresses its grave concern at and condemns the continuing
unacceptable military attacks in eastern Bosnia and the resulting
deterioration in the humanitarian situation in that region. It is
appalled that even as peace talks are continuing attacks by Serb
paramilitary units, including, reportedly, the killings of innocent
civilians, continue in eastern Bosnia. In this connection, the Security
Council is particularly concerned about the fall of the town of Cerska
and the imminent fall of neighbouring villages. The Security Council
demands that the killings and atrocities must stop and reaffirms that
those guilty of crimes against international humanitarian law will be
held individually responsible by the world community.
"""The Security Council demands that the leaders of all the parties to"
the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina remain fully
engaged in New York in a sustained effort with the 'Co-Chairmen of the
Steering Committee of the International Conference on the Former
Yugoslavia to reach quickly a fair and workable settlement. In this
connection, the Security Council also demands that all sides immediately

(The President)
cease all forms of military action throughout the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, cease acts of violence against civilians, comply with their
previous commitments, including the cease-fire, and redouble their
efforts to settle the conflict.
"""The Security Council further demands that the Bosnian Serb side, as"
well as all other parties, refrain from taking any action which might
endanger the lives and well-being of the inhabitants of eastern Bosnia,
particularly in the areas near the town of Cerska, and that all concerned
allow the unimpeded access of humanitarian relief supplies throughout the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially humanitarian access to the
besieged cities of eastern Bosnia, and permit the evacuation of the
wounded.
"""Having determined in the relevant resolutions that this situation"
constitutes a threat to international peace and security, the Security
Council insists that these steps must be taken immediately.
"""The Security Council also requests the Secretary-General to take"
immediate steps to increase UNPROFOR's presence in eastern Bosnia.
"""The Security Council remains seized of the matter and is ready to"
"meet at any moment to consider further action."""
' The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.
