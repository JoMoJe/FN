ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
The agenda was adopted.
NAVIGATION ON THE DANUBE RIVER IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF
YUGOSLAVIA (SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO)
LETTER DATED 11 OCTOBER 1993 FROM THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVE
OF HUNGARY TO THE UNITED NATIONS ADDRESSED TO THE PRESIDENT OF
THE SECURITY COUNCIL (S/26562)
The PRESIDENT: The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the
understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them document S/26562,
which contains the text of a letter dated 11 October 1993 from the
Permanent Representative of Hungary to the United Nations
addressed to the President of the Security Council.
Following consultations among members of the Security Council,
I have been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of
the Council:
PV.3290

"""The Security Council has learned with deep concern that"
the blocking of the Danube by two Serbian non-governmental
organizations is still continuing and deplores the
acquiescence of the authorities of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), which is reflected in the
fact that they have failed to take any action to prevent these
acts. It condemns these deliberate and unjustified acts of
interference with the river traffic of several Member States
of the- United Nations. It emphasizes the importance it
attaches to the free and unhindered navigation on the Danube
which is essential for legitimate trade in the region. It
reminds the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(Serbia and Montenegro) of their previous written commitment
to secure free and safe navigation on this vital international
waterway.
"""The Security Council is also concerned that the"
authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro) continue to impose tolls on foreign vessels
transiting the section of the Danube which passes through the
territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro). By extracting these payments, the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) violates its
international obligations. The Security Council rejects any
attempt to justify, on whatever ground, the imposition of
tolls on the Danube. It demands that the authorities of the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and any
others imposing similar tolls cease such action immediately.
"""The Security Council condemns these illegal actions and"
reaffirms that it is wholly unacceptable for the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to take
retaliatory measures in response to action by a State in
fulfilment of its obligations under the Charter of the United
PV.3290
4
Nations. It reminds the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(Serbia and Montenegro) of its own international obligations
and demands that its authorities ensure free movement of
international traffic on the Danube.
"""The Security Council remains seized of the matter."""
This statement will be issued as a document of the Security
Council under the symbol S/26572.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of
its consideration of the item on the agenda.
The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.
