ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
The agenda was adopted.
THE SITUATION IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): I should like to inform
the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of Bosnia
and Herzegovina in which he requests to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In accordance with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the discussion without the right to vote, in
conformity with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Sacirbev (Bosnia and Herzegovina)
took a place at the Council table.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): The Security Council
will now begin its consideration of the item on the agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.
Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have
been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:
"""The Security Council, having received a report from the"
Secretary-General, recalls all its relevant resolutions and its
statements of 25 January 1993 (S/25162) and 17 February 1993 (S/25302)
concerning the provision of humanitarian relief in the Republic of Bosnia
and Herzegovina. It is deeply concerned that, in spite of its repeated
S/PV.3177
3-5
(The President)
demands, relief efforts continue to be impeded by Serb paramilitary
units, especially in the eastern part of the country, namely in the
enclaves of Srebrenica, Cerska, Gorazde and Zepa.
"""The Security Council deplores the deterioration of the humanitarian"
situation in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina at a time when
discussions are to resume with a view to reaching a just and durable
agreement to end the conflict. It regards the blockade of relief efforts
as a serious impediment to a negotiated settlement in the Republic of
Bosnia and Herzegovina and to the efforts of the Co-Chairmen of the
Steering Committee of the International Conference on the Former
Yugoslavia. It notes with concern that the measures taken by Serb
paramilitary units to interdict humanitarian convoys, in flagrant
violation of relevant Security Council resolutions, expose the personnel
of UNPROFOR and UNHCR as well as other humanitarian organizations to
physical harm.

(The President)
"""The deliberate impeding of the delivery of food and humanitarian"
relief essential for the survival of the civilian population in the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina constitutes a violation of the Geneva
Conventions of 1949, and the Security Council is committed to ensuring
that individuals responsible for such acts are brought to justice.
"""The Security Council strongly condemns once again the blocking of"
humanitarian convoys that has impeded the delivery of humanitarian
supplies. It reiterates its demand that the Bosnian parties grant
immediate and unimpeded access for humanitarian convoys and fully comply
with the Security Council's decisions in this regard. The Security
Council expresses its strong support for the use, in full coordination
with the United Nations and in accordance with the relevant Security
Council resolutions, of humanitarian air drops in isolated areas of the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina that are in critical need of
humanitarian supplies and cannot be reached by ground convoys. It
reaffirms its firm commitment to the full implementation of the
humanitarian relief programme in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
"""The Security Council remains actively seized of the matter and"
continues its consideration of further steps, in accordance with its
"relevant resolutions."""
The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.
