EXPRESSION OF THANKS TO THE RETIRING PRESIDENT
The PRESIDENT: As this is the first meeting of the Security Council
for the month of April 1993, I should like to take this opportunity to pay
tribute, on behalf of the Council, to His Excellency Ambassador Terence
Christopher O'Brien, Permanent Representative of New Zealand to the United
Nations, for his service as President of the Security Council for the month of
March 1993. I am sure I speak for all members of the Security Council in
expressing deep appreciation to Ambassador O'Brien for the great diplomatic
skill and unfailing courtesy with which he conducted the Council's business
last month.

The PRESIDENT: I should like to inform the Council that I have
received a letter from the representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in which
he requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of the item on the
Council's agenda. In accordance with the usual practice, I propose, with the
consent of the Council, to invite that representative to participate in the
discussion without the right to vote, in conformity with the relevant
provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of
procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr, Sacirbey (Bosnia and Herzegovina)
took a place at the Council table.
"The PRESIDENT; The Security Council will now begin its"
consideration of the item on the agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have received photocopies of a letter dated
2 April 1993 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the
Security Council, which will be issued as a document of the Security Council
under the symbol S/25519.
Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have
been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:
"""The Security Council is shocked by and extremely alarmed at the"
dire and worsening humanitarian situation which has developed in
Srebrenica in the eastern part of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina
following the unacceptable decision of the Bosnian Serb party not to

KP/2/4103V
(The President)
permit any further humanitarian aid to be delivered to that town, and to
allow only evacuation of its civilian population. The relevant facts are
contained in a letter dated 2 April 1993, addressed to the
Secretary-General by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(S/25519, Annex).
"""The Security Council recalls and reaffirms all its relevant"
resolutions and statements and condemns the continuing disregard and
willful flouting of the relevant Security Council resolutions and
statements by the Bosnian Serb party, which once again, in pursuit of its
unlawful, unacceptable and abhorrent policy of 'ethnic cleansing' aimed
at territorial aggrandizement, has blocked the United Nations
humanitarian relief efforts.
"""Recognizing the imperative need to alleviate, with the utmost"
urgency, the sufferings of the population in and around Srebrenica who
are in desperate need of food, medicine, clothes and shelter, the
Security Council demands that the Bosnian Serb party cease and desist
forthwith from all violations of international humanitarian law,
including in particular the deliberate interference with humanitarian
convoys, and allow all such convoys unhindered access to the town of
Srebrenica and other parts in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Security Council demands that the Bosnian Serb party strictly comply
with all relevant resolutions of the Security Council. It further
demands that the Bosnian Serb party honour forthwith its most recent
commitment 'to guarantee the free movement of humanitarian convoys and
the protection of endangered civilians'. The Security Council also
S/PV.3192

KP/2/4103V
(The President)
reaffirms that those guilty of crimes against international humanitarian
law will be held individually responsible by the world community.
"""The Security Council commends and strongly supports the efforts of"
the brave people who have undertaken to deliver urgently needed
humanitarian assistance, under extremely trying conditions, to the
civilian population in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in
particular the efforts of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) and the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR).
"""The Security Council recalls the request it made in its statement"
of 3 March 1993 (S/25361) to the Secretary-General to take immediate
"steps to increase UNPROFOR's presence in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina;"
"welcomes the action taken already in that respect; and urges the"
Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
to use all the resources at their disposal within the scope of the
relevant resolutions of the Council to reinforce the existing
humanitarian operations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
"""The Security Council will remain actively seized of the matter."""
This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under
the symbol S/25520.	.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on the agenda.
The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.
The meeting rose at 1.25 p.m.
