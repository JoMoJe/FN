of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I

There being no objection, it is so decided.

(The President)
Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have
been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:
"""Having examined the situation in the United Nations Protected Areas"
(UNPAs) in the Republic of Croatia, the Security Council is deeply
concerned by the failure of the Krajina Serbs to participate in talks on
the implementation of its resolution 802 (1993) which were to be held in
Zagreb on 26 May 1993. It deplores the interruption of the dialogue
between the parties, which had recently produced encouraging signs of
progress.
"""The Council stresses its support for the peace process under the"
auspices of the Co-Chairmen of the International Conference on the Former
Yugoslavia and urges the parties to solve all problems which might arise
by peaceful means and resume the talks immediately with a view to the
rapid implementation of resolution 802 (1993) and all other relevant
resolutions. The;Council expresses its willingness to help ensure the
implementation of;an agreement on this basis reached by the parties,
including respect;for the rights of the local Serb population.
"""The Council";reminds the parties that the UNPAs are integral parts
of the territory of the Republic of Croatia, and that no action
inconsistent with this would be acceptable.
"""The Council reiterates its demand that international humanitarian"
law be fully respected in the UNPAs.
"""The Council urges the Government of the Republic of Croatia, in"
cooperation with other interested parties, to take all necessary measures
to ensure the full protection of the rights of all residents of the UNPAs
when the Republic of Croatia exercises fully its authority in these
"Areas."""
