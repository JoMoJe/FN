ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
The agenda was adopted.
THE SITUATION IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): I should like to inform
the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of Bosnia
and Herzegovina in which he requests to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council’s agenda. In accordance with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the discussion without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr, Sacirbev (Bosnia and Herzegovina)
took a place at the Council table.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): The Security Council
will now begin its consideration of the item on the agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.
Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have
been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:
"""The Security Council, having heard a report from the Co-Chairmen of"
the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the Former
Yugoslavia, is concerned that the present opportunity to reach a
negotiated settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina should not be allowed to
slip. It endorses fully the statement by the President of the United
S/PV.3176

(The President)
States and the Secretary-General of the United Nations on 23 February,
calling on the leaders of the parties involved in the peace talks on
Bosnia and Herzegovina to come to New York immediately to resume
discussions with a view to the early conclusion of an agreement to end
the conflict. The Council urges these leaders to respond quickly and
positively to that call, and stands ready to give its full support to the
efforts of the Co-Chairmen to bring the talks to a successful conclusion.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on the agenda.
The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.
