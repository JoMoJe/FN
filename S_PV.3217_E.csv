RESPONSIBLE FOR SERIOUS VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW COMMITTED
IN THE TERRITORY OF THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH 2 OF SECURITY
COUNCIL RESOLUTION 808 (1993) (S/25704 AND ADD.l)
"The PRESIDENT; I should like to inform the Council that I have"
received letters from the representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina and
Croatiaz in which they reguest to be invited to participate in the discussion

(The President)
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to the vote
on the draft resolution before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall now
put the draft resolution to the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
"In favour; Brazil, Cape Verde, China, Djibouti, France, Hungary, Japan,"
■ ■
Morocco, New Zealand, Pakistan, Russian Federation, Spain,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United
States of America, Venezuela
"The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Russian); There were 15 votes in"
favour. The draft resolution has therefore been adopted unanimously as
resolution 827 (1993).
I shall now call on those members of the Council who wish to make
statements following the voting.
"Mr, ARRIA (Venezuela) (interpretation from Spanish); The evolution"
of international society reveals the need to create a corrective and punitive
forum, particularly in the case of crimes affecting the very essence of the
civilized conscience, as in the case of crimes against humanity.
In Nuremberg and Tokyo we saw the emergence of international courts to
try those guilty of the crimes committed during the course of the Second World
War. Now the Security Council has decided to act on behalf of the global
community of States by establishing an International Tribunal which, as a
forum representing all humanity, will bring to trial and punish those guilty
of abominable crimes. This is the vital significance of the step the Council
has taken today as a substantive part of the Vance-Owen peace process.
S/PV.3217
7
(Mr. Arria, Venezuela)
The search for justice cannot be tainted by diplomatic or political
considerations. Too many grave violations of human rights have taken place in
many parts of the world while those responsible for them have escaped the hand
"of justice, such as the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and the warlords in Somalia;"
Sudan, Iraq and Haiti are other instances.
"But there comes a time when one must ask oneself: ""If we do not act now,"
"when will we? If we do not act in a case such as this, when will we act?"""
The Security Council has asked itself that question. It has reflected upon it
and agreed unanimously to take immediate action in the case of the former
Yugoslavia, while at the same time issuing a warning to others elsewhere that
they cannot continue violating international humanitarian law with impunity.
The Council goes even further by encouraging the establishment of a permanent
International Tribunal, as my country among many others has been advocating.
The delegation of Venezuela voted in favour of resolution 808 (1993),
which decided to establish the Tribunal, because it is convinced of the duty
incumbent upon the international community to reaffirm that the commission of
such crimes as those that have clearly been committed in this case cannot pass
without political condemnation and penal sanctions. Such a situation would be
intolerable in modern society.
My delegation recognizes that the Tribunal is intended to deal with a
specific and limited crisis that the Council has been addressing under
Chapter VII of the Charter. It also recognizes that the Tribunal, as a
subsidiary organ of the Council, would not be empowered with - nor would the
Council be assuming - the ability to set down norms of international law or to
legislate with respect to those rights. It simply applies existing
international humanitarian law.
S/PV.3217
8
(Mr, Arria, Venezuela)
Venezuela recognizes that in adopting the draft Statute of the Tribunal
the Council is also taking exceptional action. It is on the basis of this
exceptional nature of the action that we can accept aspects of the Statute
with respect to which suggestions for its refinement or improvement and
adaptation might have been made with a view to addressing the specific
features of the legal regimes of various Member States. Venezuela believes
that this ad hoc Tribunal has thus been established to act in support of the
purposes and principles of the Charter.
My delegation trusts that the ad hoc Tribunal will indeed be impartial,
because it is conceived as the expression of a commitment to an indispensable
system of international justice and in no way as an act of retaliation against
the Serbs or any other specific group. It is being established in an attempt
to bring to trial and punish anyone who proves to be guilty of the horrible
crimes that have been committed in the former Yugoslavia, as well as to
reverse the consequences of the crime of genocide committed for territorial
gain and to provide financial compensation to the victims, as the resolution
we have adopted this evening provides.
My delegation stresses that the central function of the Tribunal will be
exercised by the chief prosecutor who, as of now, should be provided with all
the necessary financial and administrative support. Otherwise, the Tribunal
will not be able to fulfil its mandate. In this respect, we suggest that the
Prosecutor should not confine himself to bringing cases before the Tribunal,
but should also present an overall report on all of the violations of
international humanitarian law that come to his knowledge, which will provide
him with an historical record of great importance.
S/PV.3217
9
(Mr, Arria, Venezuela)
Finally, I would call attention to that unfinished part of our
Organization's agenda, which refers to the creation of a permanent
international penal jurisdication. The creation of such a jurisdiction has
been debated for many years. Today, the global scope of organized criminal
activity requires a concomitant global political will to prosecute and punish
it. Accountability for criminal conduct affecting and offending humanity
should also entail global accountability. We need appropriate machinery to
address that situation, before events overwhelm us.
Pain and indignation at certain types of crimes and an outcry for justice
have become global. No one can deny that organized crime today is
transnational, defying national laws and extending beyond all national
jurisdictions. Such crimes as terrorism, money laundering, drug trafficking,
the illicit traffic in conventional and non-conventional weapons, financial
speculation and other offences committed by cartels, mafias and gangs have
grown so widespread that they are not only increasingly serious but also
increasingly sophisticated, easily able to flout national jurisdictions. Just
"as there is ""ethnic cleansing"", there is also a ""cleansing"" of judges,"
journalists, police officers and political leaders who dare to oppose
organized crime. Undoubtedly, the rights of these persons are just as
fundamental as those to be dealt with by the ad hoc Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia.
Nothing encourages crime more than impunity, and thus the international
community cannot continue to put off a global response such as a permanent
tribunal. Humanity is suffering in too many corners of the world, not only in
the former Yugoslavia.
S/PV.3217
10
(Mr, Arria, Venezuela)
This horrible dimension and reality of global crime and offenses against
international humanitarian law must come to an end. We must put an end to the
interminable legal discussions that, in delaying the establishment of
international jurisdiction, are merely encouraging impunity. That is the
reality.
Mr. MERIMEE (France) (interpretation from French): In adopting
resolution 827 (1993), the Security Council has just established an
International Tribunal that will prosecute, judge and punish people from any
community who have committed or continue to commit crimes in the territory of
the former Yugoslavia.
S/PV.3217
11
(Mr. Merimee, France)
The Nuremberg Tribunal and the Tokyo Tribunal judged, on behalf of
humanity in its entirety, those who had breached the most elementary rules.
Those Tribunals were established by the victors at the end of a war. Today,
through the Security Council, it is the international community that is
establishing the International Tribunal for Yugoslavia.
The Statute of the Tribunal that we have adopted under
resolution 827 (1993) defines its competence and mandate. The Statute was
worked out at the request of the Security Council, pursuant to
resolution 808 (1993), by the Secretary-General and his colleagues, in
particular Mr. Carl-August Fleischhauer, in a very short period of time, and
my delegation wishes to pay a tribute to the outstanding quality of their
work. That work has made it possible for us to adopt the draft Statute very
quickly and without amendment.
I should like to make a few brief comments on this subject: firstly, the
"expression ""laws or customs of war"" used in Article 3 of the Statute covers"
specifically, in the opinion of France, all the obligations that flow from the
humanitarian law agreements in force on the territory of the former Yugoslavia
at the time when the offences were committed.
Secondly, with regard to Article 5, that Article applies to all the acts
set out therein when committed in violation of the law during a period of
armed conflict on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, within the context
of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population for
national, political, ethnic, racial or religious reasons.
Thirdly, we believe that, pursuant to Article 9, paragraph 2, the
Tribunal may intervene at any stage of the procedure and assert its primacy,
including from the stage of investigation where appropriate, in the situations
covered under Article 10, paragraph 2.
S/PV.3217
12
(Mr. Merimee, France)
Resolution 827 (1993) was adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter. The
threat to international peace and security created by the serious situation in
the former Yugoslavia justifies recourse to those provisions. This
resolution, which is a decision within the meaning of Article 25 of the
Charter, thus now applies to all States. This means, specifically, that all
States are required to cooperate fully with the Tribunal, even if this obliges
them to amend certain provisions of their domestic law.
France is pleased, therefore, that the initiative that it took this past
February has led to such a resounding expression by the United Nations of our
common resolve not to tolerate infamy and to assert the rule of law. My
country hopes that this message will be understood by all and that it will
help silence the guns on the territory of the former Yugoslavia.
Mrs, ALBRIGHT (United States of America): Today we begin to cleanse
the hatred that has torn apart the former Yugoslavia. A few months ago, I
said:
"""This will be no victors' tribunal. The only victor that will"
"prevail in this endeavour is the truth."" (S/PV.3175, o, 11)"
Truth is the cornerstone of the rule of law, and it will point towards
individuals, not peoples, as perpetrators of war crimes. And it is only the
truth that can cleanse the ethnic and religious hatreds and begin the healing
process.
Included among the millions who will learn of this resolution are the
hundreds of thousands of civilians who are the victims of horrific war crimes
and crimes against humanity in the former Yugoslavia. To these victims we
declare by this action that your agony, your sacrifice, and your hope for
S/PV.3217
13
(Mrs, Albright, United States)
justice have not been forgotten. And to those who committed these heinous
crimes, we have a very clear message: war criminals will be prosecuted and
justice will be rendered.
The crimes being committed, even as we meet today, are not just isolated
acts of drunken militiamen, but often are the systematic and orchestrated
crimes of Government officials, military commanders, and disciplined
artillerymen and foot soldiers. The men and women behind these crimes are
"individually responsible for the crimes of those they purport to control; the"
fact that their power is often self-proclaimed does not lessen their
culpability.
Those sceptics - including the war criminals - who deride this Tribunal
as being powerless because the suspects may avoid arrest should not be so
confident. The Tribunal will issue indictments whether or not suspects can be
taken into custody. They will become international pariahs. While these
individuals may be able to hide within the borders of Serbia or in parts of
Bosnia or Croatia, they will be imprisoned for the rest of their lives within
their own land. Under today's resolution, every Government, including each
one in the former Yugoslavia, will be obligated to hand over those indicted by
the Tribunal.
We must ensure that the voices of the groups most victimized are heard by
the Tribunal. I refer particularly to the detention and systematic rape of
women and girls, often followed by cold-blooded murder. Let the tens of
thousands of women and girls who courageously survived the brutal assault of
cowards who call themselves soldiers know this: your dignity survives, as
does that of those who died.
S/PV.3217
14
(Mrs. Albright, United States)
The Honourable Geraldine Ferraro, who recently represented the United
States on the Human Rights Commission, said of this crime:
"""Rape should not be used as a weapon of war. It should also not be used"
as a tool for revenge... Women's rights are human rights, and must be
"respected as such."""
The International Tribunal will prosecute the rapists and murderers and their
superiors.
My Government is also determined to see that women jurists sit on the
Tribunal and that women prosecutors bring war criminj'ls to justice. Our view
is shared by all of the women Permanent Representatives of this Organization.
We also take note of the recommendation of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference that gender be duly represented on the Tribunal.
Today's resolution contains important provisions designed to ensure the
expeditious establishment of the Tribunal. It is imperative that I take some
time to state clearly and completely the understandings which underpin my
Government's support for this resolution and for the Statute of the Tribunal.
To begin, we want to stress the importance of three provisions in particular.
Today's resolution ensures that the United Nations Commission of Experts
will continue to pursue its work of establishing a database and preparing
evidence during the interim period before the appointment of the Tribunal's
Prosecutor and hiring of staff to begin authoritative investigations and
preparations for trials. We expect that the Secretary-General will provide
the Commission with the space, resources and personnel necessary to continue
its mandate, and we urge other countries to follow our lead in pledging
financial contributions to the Commission. At the appropriate time, we expect
the Commission would cease to exist and that its work would be folded into the
Prosecutor's office.
S/PV.3217
15
(Mrs, Albright, United States)
The resolution also encourages States to submit proposals for the rules
of evidence and procedure for consideration by the judges of the Tribunal. We
hope to contribute to this critical process of developing the rules that the
Tribunal can expeditiously adopt so that the Prosecutor will then be in a
position to begin prosecuting cases without further delay.
In addition, the resolution recognizes that States may find it necessary
to take measures under their domestic law to enable them to implement the
provisions of the Statute, and pledges them to endeavour to take any such
measures as soon as possible. That is certainly the intention of the United
States.
We commend the Secretariat for its outstanding report, which has laid the
foundation for today's action by the Council. While the Council has adopted
the Statute for the Tribunal as proposed in that report, the members of the
Council have recognized that the Statute raises several technical issues that
can be addressed through interpretive statements.
In particular, we understand that other members of the Council share our
view regarding the following clarifications related to the Statute:
"Firstly, it is understood that the ""laws .or customs of war"" referred to"
in Article 3 include all obligations under humanitarian law agreements in
force in the territory of the former Yugoslavia at the time the acts were
committed, including common article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, and the
1977 Additional Protocols to these Conventions.
S/PV.3217
16
(Mrs. Albright, United States)
Secondly, it is understood that Article 5 applies to all acts listed in
that article, when committed contrary to law during a period of armed conflict
in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, as part of a widespread or
systematic attack against any civilian population on national, political,
ethnic, racial, gender, or religious grounds.
Thirdly, it is understood that the primacy of the International Tribunal
referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 9 only refers to the situations
described in Article 10.
The United States wishes also to offer several other clarifications
related to the provisions of the Statute:
With respect to paragraph 1 of Article 7, it is our understanding that
individual liability arises in the case of a conspiracy to commit a crime
referred to in Articles 2 through 5, or the failure of a superior - whether
political or military - to take reasonable steps to prevent or punish such
crimes by persons under his or her authority. It is, of course, a defence
that the accused was acting pursuant to orders where he or she did not know
the orders were unlawful and a person of ordinary sense and understanding
would not have known the orders to be unlawful.
With respect to Article 10, it is our understanding that the Tribunal is
authorized to conduct proceedings against persons previously tried by a
national court for the same crime when national proceedings - including
clemency, parole, and other similar relief - were not impartial or
independent, were designed to shield the accused from international criminal
responsibility, or were not diligently prosecuted.
"With respect to Article 19, we understand that the reference to ""prima"
"facie"" case in paragraph 1 means a reasonable basis to believe that a crime as"
S/PV.3217
17
(Mrs, Albright, United States)
defined in Articles 2 through 5, has been committed by the person named in the
indictment.
Finally, with respect to Article 24, it is our understanding that
compensation to victims by a convicted person may be an appropriate part of
decisions on sentencing, reduction of sentences, parole or commutation. We
also understand that the Tribunal may impose a sentence of life imprisonment,
or consecutive sentences for multiple offences, in any appropriate case.
With the adoption of the Statute for the Tribunal, we have completed the
most difficult part of the task we began in February with resolution
808 (1993) when that was approved by the Council. We must now move without
delay to the next steps, particularly the appointment of the prosecutor and
the selection of judges.
Finally, of this we are certain: the Tribunal must succeed, for the
sake of the victims and for the credibility of international law in this new
era.
Sir David HANNAY (United Kingdom)s The United Kingdom Government
has been horrified at the continued evidence of massive breaches of
international humanitarian law and human rights in the former Yugoslavia, the
abuse of women, the deliberate obstruction of humanitarian relief convoys,
forced population movements, forcible surrender of property and the deliberate
military targeting of civilian populations. Above all, the practice of
"""ethnic cleansing"" has managed to combine the commitment of the most odious of"
crimes for the most base purposes. All parties in the former Yugoslavia share
some responsibility for these crimes, and it is important to emphasize that
the action the Council is taking today is not aimed at one party alone. The
Security Council has repeatedly demanded the immediate cessation of such
atrocities, but these demands have not been heeded. It is essential that
S/PV.3217
18
'	(Sir David Hannav, United Kingdom)
those who commit such acts be in no doubt that they will be held individually
responsible. It is essential that these atrocities be investigated and the
perpetrators called to account, whoever and wherever they may be.
It is against this background, and in the very special circumstances
pertaining in the former Yugoslavia, that the Council has decided to
establish, as an ad hoc measure, a Tribunal for the prosecution of those
responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law in the
former Yugoslavia. This is an exceptional step needed to deal with
exceptional circumstances. At the same time, my Government continues to
support the work of the International Law Commission, which will result, we
hope, in the establishment of an international criminal court with general
jurisdiction.
We therefore fully supported resolution 808 (1993), in which the Council
decided in principle on the establishment of an ad hoc Tribunal to deal with
the serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the
former Yugoslavia since 1991. We welcome and endorse the Secretary-General's
excellent report on the most effective and expeditious means of establishing
the Tribunal.
It is of the greatest importance for the effective functioning of the
Tribunal that the judges, prosecutor and staff are persons with considerable
practical experience in the field of criminal prosecution. The Tribunal has
very specific purposes, to try persons for serious criminal offences, and it
is essential that all involved are experts in the field.
Articles 9 and 10 of the Statute deal with the relationship between the
International Tribunal and national courts. In our view, the primacy of the
Tribunal, referred to in Article 9, paragraph 2, relates primarily to the
courts in the territory of former Yugoslavia: elsewhere it will only be in
S/PV.3217
19
(Sir David Hannav, United Kingdom)
the kinds of exceptional circumstances outlined in Article 10, paragraph 2,
that primacy should be applicable.
Articles 2 to 5 of the draft Statute describe the crimes within the
jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The Statute does not, of course, create new
law, but reflects existing international law in this field. In this
connection, it would be our view that the reference to the laws or customs of
war in Article 3 is broad enough to include applicable international
conventions and that Article 5 covers acts committed in time of armed conflict.
As the resolution makes clear, it will be necessary for States to
establish their own procedures for implementing their obligations under the
Statute. Thus, for example, domestic procedures will be needed to give effect
to the obligation under Article 29 to comply with a request or order
concerning the surrender or transfer of an accused to the International
Tribunal.
It will be for the General Assembly to make the necessary budgetary
allocations for the effective functioning of the Tribunal, and in due course
its appropriate subordinate bodies will need to scrutinize very carefully the
financial arrangements and provisions for the Tribunal.
We strongly support the resolution that has just been adopted. The
establishment of the Tribunal sends a clear message to all in the former
Yugoslavia that they must stop immediately violations of international
humanitarian law or face the consequences. We hope that message will be
heeded.
S/PV.3217
20
Mr, ERDOS (Hungary) (interpretation from French): Hungary attaches
the greatest importance to the unanimous adoption of resolution 827 (1993) of
the Security Council. This is the first time that the United Nations
establishes an international criminal jurisdiction to prosecute persons who
commit grave violations of international humanitarian law.
This initiative is a logical follow-up of the process begun by Security
Council resolution 764 (1992) which emphasized the individual responsibilities
for grave violations of the 1949 Geneva Conventions in former Yugoslavia,
violations which constitute horrific crimes without precedent in Europe since
the end of the Second World War.
On the basis of the information that has reached us from several
sources, as well as from the Commission of Experts established by the Security
Council, the Council, in resolution 808 (1993)> noted that the violations of
international humanitarian law, because of their gravity and their generalized
character, constituted a threat to international peace and security, which, in
our view, fully justifies the competence of the Security Council in this
sphere.
We believe that resolution 827 (1993) represents a balance between the
complex political and legal requirements and, above all, creates the specific
conditions necessary for the Tribunal to be set up and to begin its activity
promptly.
We note also the importance of the fact that the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal covers the whole range of international humanitarian law and the
entire duration of the conflict throughout the territory of former Yugoslavia.
S/PV.3217
21
(Mr. E rdo s, Hungary)
The Statute of the Tribunal allows the prosecution of all persons - not
communities - charged with crimes where the crime was committed in the
territory of former Yugoslavia and without regard to their ethnic
affiliation. We note also that the official status of the individual brought
to court, whatever it might be, does not immunize him from his criminal
liability. In the light of the significance of implementing the goals set for
the Tribunal and in the light of their complexity, it is important that the
Tribunal be made up of highly qualified persons, both in theory and in
practice, in order properly to carry out under optimal conditions the tasks
that are conferred on them.
Hungary has firmly supported all resolutions of the Security Council
concerning grave violations of international humanitarian law. Hungary is
convinced that persons who commit or order the commission of grave and
systematic violations of that law should not escape the hand of justice, and
their acts cannot enjoy impunity. We are deeply convinced that it is
impossible to envisage a lasting settlement of the conflict in the former
Yugoslavia, including in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, without the
"prosecution of those who massacre and burn children, women and elderly people;"
"■who, with diabolical regularity, shell innocent civilian populations; who"
"practice ""ethnic cleansing"", the true tragic implications of which have not"
"yet been fully appreciated; who cut off the water supplies of besieged"
"communities; who deliberately destroy cultural or religious property, and so"
on.
On the basis of these considerations, Hungary voted in favour of the
draft resolution in the hope that its adoption and the expeditious
establishment of the Tribunal will contribute effectively to bringing an end
to violations of international humanitarian law and will send the right
message to those at whom this resolution is aimed.
S/PV.3217
22
Mr, O'BRIEN (New Zealand)s New Zealand welcomes the adoption of
this resolution, which it co-sponsored. We particularly commend the report of
the Secretary-General, including the Statute for the Tribunal to try persons
responsible for violations of international humanitarian law in the territory
of the former Yugoslavia. Like others here tonight, we congratulate the
Secretary-General for the lucidity of his report and for the comprehensiveness
of the Statute, which in large measure accords with New Zealand's own
perceptions of what the Tribunal should do. We consider that it is
appropriate that the Council has approved the Statute in toto here tonight.
The atrocities reportedly committed in the territory of the former
Yugoslavia, notably in Bosnia and Herzegovina, have horrified and continue to
horrify all of us. New Zealand considers that it is imperative that persons
"responsible for acts of ""ethnic cleansing"", the forced expulsion of people,"
systematic rape, torture and murder are brought to trial and are punished.
The establishment of the Tribunal by this resolution ensures that we have in
place an effective mechanism to achieve these ends.
As is noted in the resolution and in the Secretary-General's report, the
establishment of the Tribunal and the prosecution of persons suspected of
crimes against international humanitarian law is closely related to the wider
efforts to restore peace and security to the former Yugoslavia. This is an
important point. We recall that in the Secretary-General's report of
2 February, the Co-Chairmen of the International Conference specifically state
that human rights and humanitarian issues are the core elements of the
peacemaking process in the former Yugoslavia. In restating then their
advocacy of the creation of the Tribunal, Messrs. Vance and Owen stated that
the situation on the ground was not acceptable. Since February, of course,
S/PV.3217
23
(Mr. O'Brien, New Zealand)
"that situation has not improved; quite the contrary. It is important here to"
underline this, because our decision tonight, and indeed the tribunal itself,
does have a context. The Co-Chairmen set it explicitly within the peacemaking
process. Implementation of that process and the work of the Tribunal must
mutually reinforce one another.
We must remember, however, that the Tribunal is a court. Its task is to
apply independently and impartially the rules of customary international law
and, we believe, conventional law applicable in the territory of the former •
Yugoslavia. The Tribunal must be left to carry out its work until it has
discharged its mandate under its Statute or until the Council decides that its
"work shall be brought to an end;"
Mr. MARUYAMA (Japan): I do not believe it is necessary to elaborate
on the appalling situation in the former Yugoslavia. The violations of
international humanitarian law in the region are extraordinary in their scope,
gravity and persistence. The humanitarian implications are enormous, not only
for the present generation but also for generations to come.
The magnitude of the crisis is clearly demonstrated in unanimously
adopted resolution 808 (1993), which declared the situation to be a threat to
international peace and security. Its particular circumstances indeed demand
exceptional measures and have motivated the Security Council to take action
under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter.
Japan is fully aware of the extraordinary and complex nature of the
effort to establish an ad hoc Tribunal. It is incumbent upon us to ensure
that the Tribunal is independent and neutral and that it reflects the
universal authority of the United Nations. We are also required to work out a
sound legal basis for the establishment and functioning of the Tribunal, and
S/PV.3217
24-25
(Mr, Maruyama, Japan)
to seek adequate resources. This should be accomplished without delay, with a
view to enabling the international community to respond to the tragic
humanitarian situation very quickly and in the cause of justice.
Prompted by the imminent danger and accommodating a number of difficult
issues, the Secretary-General has provided us with an excellent report which
strikes a proper balance among a variety of factors, particularly between
political and legal demands. Japan believes that his report has enabled us to
take an immediate decision and deserves our sincere appreciation.
Perhaps more extensive legal studies could have been undertaken on
various aspects of the Statute, such as the question of the principle of
nullum crimen sine lege and on measures to establish a bridge with domestic
legal systems. In this connection, Japan has kept in close consultation with
the President as well as with the Secretariat. At the same time, Japan fully
shares the determination of the international community, which calls for the
exhaustion of all possible measures, including the expeditious establishment
of the Tribunal, to put an end to the ongoing atrocities in the former
Yugoslavia and restore justice. This is the reason why Japan supported the
adoption of the resolution and why it intends to cooperate in its
implementation to the best of its ability, in accordance with the spirit of
internationally established principles on criminal matters and within our
Constitution.
The Statute of the International Tribunal itself reflects the way of
thinking of the Security Council. First, it is obvious that the commencement
of activities by the Tribunal in no way relieves the parties concerned of
their obligation to enforce international humanitarian law.
S/PV.3217
26
(Mr. Maruyama, Japan)
Secondly, it is equally obvious that such legal remedies in no way
relieve the Security Council of its enormous responsibility to address the
Yugoslav crisis in its entirety.
Thirdly, cooperation and assistance on the part of the States concerned
is essential to guarantee the smooth functioning of the Tribunal. If there is
any politically misguided effort to block such cooperation, our exercise could
be seriously hampered. All States must exhaust all means to cooperate in good
faith. Japan stands ready to implement the common spirit of the international
community and make the best use of the relevant laws and regulations in
extending its maximum possible cooperation.
The Security Council is obliged to take the exceptional measures it is
taking today. Yet it cannot be argued that these measures lie outside the
Council's jurisdiction, for the very complexity of the threat and the gravity
of the crisis have made the Council's action inevitable. On the contrary, it
may be argued that, without a comprehensive strategy on the part of the
international community, the complex situation in the former Yugoslavia cannot
be properly addressed. We must respond to this formidable problem immediately.
Mr, SNOUSSI (Morocco) (interpretation from French): I wish at the
outset to congratulate you, Sir, on the very effective way in which you have
performed the duties of President this month.
Nor can I fail to say how much we appreciated the presidency of
Ambassador Marker of Pakistan, which was marked by great skill and wisdom.
It gives me pleasure also to pay a well-deserved tribute to the
Secretary-General for his remarkable report, which enabled us to prepare the
resolution adopted this evening.
S/PV.3217
27
(Mr, Snoussi, Morocco)
The resolution we have just adopted will certainly breathe new life into
the Council's daily efforts in a tragic situation where the prospects for a
just and final solution are, unfortunately, not encouraging. Despite all our
resolutions, despite the positions we have taken on these grave violations,
the Bosnian Serbs have not responded to the urgent appeals of the Security
Council. On the contrary, they have persisted in their defiance of the
international community.
Thus, no one can doubt that the urgent establishment of this
International Tribunal marks a turning-point in this tragedy. Yet, however
important it may be, this special measure can be fully effective only within
the context of overall action by the Council to settle this terrible conflict
and restore international peace and security in the region. That is why it
has always been our view that an international tribunal must be but one
element of a plan, based on the principles of the United Nations Charter, to
put an end to Serb aggression, to demand the return of territory acquired by
"force and ""ethnic cleansing"" and fully to restore the territorial integrity,"
unity and sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We are convinced that the International Tribunal will promote the justice
to which we all aspire and will strengthen the rule of law in international
relations. The tribunal must seek to punish serious violations of
humanitarian law in the broadest sense as crimes against international peace
and security. No guilty party will be spared the punishment commensurate with
the seriousness of the crime. By virtue of the rule of universal
jurisdiction, national courts will also have a role to play with respect to
crimes beyond the purview of the International Tribunal. The legitimacy and
"legality of the Tribunal should not be questioned; the Tribunal should hand"
down deterrent sentences both for those who commit crimes and for their
S/PV.3217
28
(Mr, Snoussi, Morocco)
accomplices, and should not ignore appropriate compensation for victims and
their families. Nor should the International Tribunal's sentences ignore the
responsibility of States for breaches of international law attributable to
them.
Yet we must recall that the effectiveness and credibility of the
Tribunal, which must be independent and neutral, will depend on the political,
legal, financial and technical support of the international community. All
States have the obligation to cooperate with and support the Tribunal so it
can carry out its mandate to the satisfaction of the victims and their
families.
In conclusion, my delegation hopes sincerely that the establishment of
this International Tribunal will restore hope to the civilian populations and,
especially, restore its trust in the international community, whose moral
norms and laws have been flouted for too long.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Russian): I thank the
representative of Morocco for the kind words he addressed to me and to my
predecessor.
Mr, BARBOSA (Cape Verde) (interpretation from French): The grave
violations of international humanitarian law committed every day in the
territory of the former Yugoslavia, in particular in Bosnia and Herzegovina,
shock the conscience of mankind. In this Council, my country has repeatedly
expressed its profound indignation and its condemnation of these acts of
"massive torture, murder and rape, and of the abominable practice of ""ethnic"
"cleansing"", all of which have been confirmed by the Commission of Experts"
established pursuant to the relevant provisions of resolution 780 (1992) and
by the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights.
S/PV.3217
29-30
(Mr, Barbosa, Cape Verde)
Thus, we strongly favoured the Council's adoption of its resolution
808 (1993), since which the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina has
dangerously deteriorated, jeopardizing efforts to implement a peace plan for
that country. This situation is no longer tolerable, and it justifies the
adoption Of this evening's resolution. My delegation was an active
participant in the process leading to its adoption, and hence voted in favour
of it.
The sense that its adoption was important and urgent must not make us
lose our orientation and forget the Council's weighty responsibilities under
the Charter of the United Nations. We believe that the establishment of the
International Tribunal, which begins today, however important it may be, must
be but the first step in a long and complex process. First of all, we must
overcome all the difficulties and obstacles that will certainly appear as we
seek to establish the Tribunal, starting with financial problems that do not
appear easily resolved.
Moreover, my delegation considers that the establishment of the Tribunal
will be a positive step only if it is viewed as closely connected to a
suitably comprehensive peace plan capable of preserving international peace
and security throughout the territory of the Socialist Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia. Needless to say, this will be impossible Unless an end is put to
the aggression against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, unless the
■ .1
freedom of its people is fully achieved, and unless its sovereignty and
territorial integrity are respected.	|
As we seec it, the establishment of this Tribunal to judge and punish war
'	I
crimes is an instrument for the promotion of international peace and security.
S/PV.3217
31
(Mr, Barbosa, Cape Verde)
That was the basis of the Council's recourse to this procedure to establish
it. We therefore hope that approval of this step will encourage us to act in
our search for effective solutions to the problems that we confront in that
part of Europe, in keeping with the peace plan regarded by all members of the
Council as the only realistic framework for providing a solution giving
lasting peace for the territory of the former Yugoslavia.
Before I conclude, I am happy to convey to the Secretary-General, Mr.
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and to the Secretariat team headed by Mr. Fleischhauer,
the high commendation of the Government of Cape Verde for the outstanding work
they have done in such a short time. We also salute all the countries that
have made important contributions to the concept of the Tribunal, beginning
with France, as well as international and intergovernmental bodies.
Mr, MARKER: (Pakistan) Together with the other members of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, Pakistan has consistently and strongly
advocated the early establishment of a special tribunal for the prosecution of
persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law
committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991. My delegation
is therefore pleased with the adoption of resolution 827 (1993) by the Council.
In this connection, my delegation wishes to express its sincere
appreciation and thanks for the excellent report of the Secretary-General,
together with the Statute of the International Tribunal, contained in document
S/25704, which we regard as a document of historic proportions and a landmark
in the process of the implementation of human rights and humanitarian law.
S/PV.3217.
32
(Mr» Marker, Pakistan)
"We believe that ""ethnic cleansing"", genocide and other heinous crimes"
have been committed in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in flagrant
violation of international humanitarian law, with the specific objective of
acquiring territory and as a deliberate campaign to exterminate the Republic
of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a sovereign State Member of the United Nations. We
trust that the establishment of an international tribunal and the prosecution
of persons responsible for crimes against humanity and international
humanitarian law will contribute to ensuring that such crimes are halted and
that territories forcefully occupied as a result of such crimes are vacated by
the aggressors. This will also contribute towards the full restoration of the
unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
My delegation is committed to the comprehensive implementation of the
peace plan in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, based on the principles
of the United Nations Charter. We believe that the resolution we have just
adopted is an important element of the Vance-Owen peace process and falls
squarely within its ambit.
The international community must halt the aggression, reverse it through
"withdrawals from all territories occupied by the use of force and ""ethnic"
"cleansing"" and restore international legality. The Security Council must move"
swiftly to take further appropriate and effective enforcement actions in this
direction. We cannot accept, even by implication, the status quo imposed by
"aggression, the use of force and ""ethnic cleansing"". This would set a most"
dangerous precedent for the civilized world.
S/PV.3217
33
Mr, LI Zhaoxing (China) (interpretation from Chinese): China has
consistently opposed crimes that violate international humanitarian law and
advocated that criminals in this category should be brought to justice.
Bearing in mind the particular circumstances in the former Yugoslavia and the
urgency of restoring and maintaining world peace, the Chinese delegation voted
in favour of the resolution we have just adopted.
This political position of ours, however, should not be construed as our
endorsement of the legal approach involved. We have always held that, to
avoid setting any precedent for abusing Chapter VII of the Charter, a prudent
attitude should be adopted with regard to the establishment of an
international tribunal by means of Security Council resolutions under Chapter
VII. it is the consistent position of the Chinese delegation that an
international tribunal should be established by concluding a treaty so as to
provide a solid legal foundation for it and ensure its effective functioning.
Furthermore, the Statute of the International Tribunal just adopted is a
legal instrument with the attributes of an international treaty involving
complicated legal and financial questions. It ought to become effective only
after having been negotiated and concluded by sovereign States and ratified by
their national legislative organs in accordance with domestic laws.
Therefore, to adopt by a Security Council resolution the Statute of the
International Tribunal which gives the Tribunal both preferential and
exclusive jurisdiction is not in compliance with the principle of State
judicial sovereignty. The adoption of the Statute of the International
Tribunal by the Security Council through a resolution by invoking Chapter VII
means that United Nations Member States must implement it to fulfil their
obligations provided for in the Charter. This will bring many problems and
difficulties both in theory and in practice. For this reason, China has
consistently maintained its reservations.
S/PV.3217
34
(Mr, Li Zhaoxincr, China)
In short, the Chinese delegation emphasizes that the International
Tribunal established in the current manner can only be an ad hoc arrangement
suited only to the special circumstances of the former Yugoslavia and shall
not constitute any precedent.
Mr. SARDENBERG (Brazil): Sometimes exceptionally grave
circumstances may demand exceptional action on the part of the United Nations
and of Member States. The action taken today by the Security Council on the
establishment of an ad hoc international tribunal on war crimes in the former
Yugoslavia falls clearly into that category.
The reports of widespread violations of international humanitarian law in
the territory of the former Yugoslavia have caused deep shock and outrage in
Brazil, as in other countries. The strongest words would not be strong enough
to express the depth of our condemnation of the atrocities committed in the
context of the armed conflict in that subregion of the European continent.
In the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, the most basic norms of
humanity have been systematically trodden underfoot. Innocent civilians,
including children, have been the victims of acts of unspeakable brutality, in
utter disregard of the protection which, under international law, they are
entitled to enjoy in a situation of armed conflict. That has included
widespread violence against women of all ages, including a horrifying pattern
of sexual assault against Muslim women. Religious persecution and racially
motivated crimes have been brought to a new abhorrent level, expressed by the
"unacceptable phrase ""ethnic cleansing""."
Such criminal events could not in any way be tolerated by the
international community. A cry for justice was voiced by each of the victims
S/PV.3217
35
(Mr. Sardenberq, Brazil)
of the crimes committed in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia# and that cry
has echoed in this Chamber. In resolution 808 (1993)# the Security Council
had already decided that an international tribunal should be established for
the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international
humanitarian law.
Brazil examined with great care the proposals for the establishment# by
the Security Council itself, of such an international tribunal. In that
consideration# we found that such proposals posed intricate and not
unimportant legal difficulties, many of which were not resolved to our
satisfaction.
S/PV.3217
36
(Mr. Sardenbera, Brazil)
Given the legal difficulties involved, which in the normal course of
events would have required much more extensive study and deliberation and
could have prevented us from supporting the initiative, it was only the
consideration of the unique and exceptionally serious circumstances in the
former Yugoslavia that determined the vote we cast on the resolution we have
just adopted. Our positive vote is to be understood as a political expression
of our condemnation of the crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia and of
our heartfelt wish to contribute to bringing to justice, with the urgency that
is imposed on us by the facts, all persons responsible for such acts. It
should not be construed as an overall endorsement of legal formulas involved
in the foundation or in the Statute of the International Tribunal.
We would certainly have preferred that an initiative bearing such
far-reaching political and legal implications had received a much deeper
examination in a context that allowed a broader participation by all States
Members of the United Nations. To that end, we believe it would have been
appropriate for this matter also to be brought to the attention of the General
Assembly.
The views of the Brazilian Government on the main legal issues involved
in the establishment and functioning of the Tribunal were expressed in the
statement made on the occasion of the adoption of resolution 808 (1993) and in
the memorandum submitted by Brazil and circulated in connection with that
resolution in document S/25540. In particular, Brazil expressed the view that
the most appropriate and effective method for establishing the International
Tribunal would be the conclusion of a convention setting up an ad hoc
international criminal jurisdiction and containing the terms of reference for
its exercise.
S/PV.3217
37
(Mr. Sardenberg, Brazil)
The option of establishing the Tribunal exclusively through a resolution
of the Security Council, which we did not favour, leaves unresolved a number
of serious legal issues relating to the powers and competences attributed to
the Council by the United Nations Charter. That fact will not and should not
limit the effectiveness of the work of the International Tribunal. It does
limit, however, in our understanding, the conclusions that could be drawn from
the adoption of this resolution as regards the legal and political framework
for the work of the Security Council.
It is our view that the resolution is aimed at addressing a specific and
unique situation with a view to producing one specific result: bringing to
justice the persons responsible for serious violations of international
humanitarian law in the former Yugoslavia. Both the resolution and the
Statute it adopts are thus not meant to establish new norms or precedents of
international law. At any rate, it would not be for the Security Council to
do that. The report of the Secretary-General, which is approved by the
resolution, makes it clear that by adopting this resolution the Security
Council is not creating or purporting to legislate international humanitarian
law and that the International Tribunal will have the task of applying
existing norms of international humanitarian law.
For the work of the International Tribunal to be effective, it will be
essential that it receive the fullest cooperation of all States. That is a
clear obligation resulting from the resolution adopted today. For its part,
the Brazilian Government is determined, should the need arise, to cooperate
fully with the International Tribunal in strict accordance with the relevant
Brazilian legislation, which includes the observance of the constitutional
competence of the Brazilian Supreme Court to process and judge requests for
extradition.
S/PV.3217
38
Mr■ YANEZ BARNUEVO (Spain) (interpretation from Spanish):
Resolution 827 (1993), which the Council has just adopted, is the logical
consequence of resolution 808 (1993), adopted last February. On that
occasion, the Council decided to establish an international tribunal to bring
to trial those charged with serious violations of international humanitarian
law perpetrated since 1991 in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. It also
urged the Secretary-General to submit a report containing specific proposals
for the implementation of that decision. The Secretary-General, with the
efficient assistance of the Legal Counsel, has completed that task and
submitted an excellent report. On that basis, the Council is now proceeding
to establish the Tribunal. Spain has already expressed its support in
principle for the establishment of the International Tribunal and has now
confirmed its support for that establishment in co-sponsoring and voting in
favour of resolution 827 (1993).
The Secretary-General’s report and the Statute of the Tribunal that it
contains in its annex respond to a great extent to the concerns of the Spanish
Government in this area as expressed in the comments and suggestions which it
transmitted to the Secretary-General pursuant to the provisions of resolution
808 (1993). Naturally, the Statute can be improved upon and we might have
benefited from certain particular improvements, especially in determining the
substantive subject matter and temporal jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the
characterization of crimes and penalties. Nevertheless, we have preferred to
retain the form proposed by the Secretary-General in its entirety for several
reasons.
First, certain clarifications can be found by reading the Statute in the
light of the explanations provided in the Secretary-General's report with
respect to each Article. Other clarifications can be contributed by the
S/PV.3217
39-40
(Mr, Yanez Barnuevo, Spain)
Tribunal itself when it drafts its rules of procedure and begins carrying out
its judicial activities, which will consist in applying abstract rules to
concrete cases, thus spelling out their content. Finally, and most
importantly, the goal of restoring peace in the territory of the former
Yugoslavia requires prompt action, which might have been compromised through a
prolonged and detailed discussion of a Statute which satisfies the fundamental
prerequisites for ensuring the achievement of that goal.
Indeed, although the Statute lacks express provisions in this respect,
the Tribunal does appear as a clearly independent organ. This derives both
from the qualifications required of its members and from the procedure for
their selection, which includes the participation of the Security Council and
the General Assembly. It derives above all from the autonomy of its
machinery, which is not subject to any external review. In this connection,
we should recall that this independence is not at all incompatible with its
formal character as a subsidiary organ of the Council, as is borne out by the
jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice with respect to the United
Nations Administrative Tribunal and its relations with the General Assembly.
Secondly, we have here an impartial body governed by the law itself in
fulfilling its duties. Its jurisdiction encompasses all of the territory of
the former Yugoslavia and actions by all parties involved in the conflict or
conflicts in that area. Moreover, its activity is governed by the general
principles of law, in particular respect for the guarantees of due process and
the rights of the accused. We should especially emphasize that the Statute
rules out any trial of the accused in absentia or the imposition of the death
penalty.
Thirdly, we are creating a body that we wish to be effective. To that
end, it is indispensable to impose upon States an obligation to cooperate with
the Tribunal that is based upon Chapter VII of the Charter.
S/PV.3217
41
(Mr, Yanez Barnuevo, Spain)
That obligation implies the duty to promulgate any domestic legal measures
that may be necessary. A particularly important feature of this obligation is
the primacy accorded the International Tribunal over national courts.
Lastly, the resolution creates an ad hoc body with a jurisdiction limited
not only geographically and temporally but also materially, in that it will be
circumscribed to applying the international law in force. In fact, with the
establishment of the Tribunal, we are not seeking not to create new
international law or to change existing law but to guarantee effectively
respect for that law.
In the final analysis, the Council, by adopting resolution 827 (1993) is
seeking to make a reality of the determination contained in the preamble of
the Charter to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and
worth of the human person, and indeed to establish conditions for the
maintenance of justice and respect for international law in so tragic a
situation as that unfortunately still being experienced by the peoples of the
former Yugoslavia.
It is our hope that this crucial step that was taken today by the Council
will also serve to encourage the speedy completion in the General Assembly of
the work leading to the establishment of an international criminal tribunal of
a permanent kind and with universal jurisdiction, the need for which is
becoming increasingly imperative, as demonstrated by the conflicts not only in
the former Yugoslavia but also in similar situations elsewhere that also call
for justice to be done by the international community.
S/PV.3217
42
Mr. OLHAYE (Djibouti) (interpretation from French): Resolution
827 (1993), which we have just adopted following the report of the
Secretary-General, to whom we pay a tribute, is a new measure taken by the
Council to judge those charged with serious violations of international
humanitarian law committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia since
1991, in particular in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Since the Serbian forces in Bosnia, supported by the Belgrade Government,
started the war in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, they have, faithful
to animal instincts, never stopped carrying out their insane policy of
dismantling a sovereign, independent State and of wiping from the face of the
Earth all that was Bosnia.
Those forces, which have death squad commandos operating in their midst
who are quite rightly being called war criminals, have been hired and paid by
former Bosnian Serb political chiefs such as Karadzic and his ilk, who are
thirsty for blood and for absolute power. This is why it is not appropriate
to lump the whole thing together and call it a civil war in Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
The concentration camps, the mass expulsion and deportation of civilians,
"the raping of women - in short, the ""ethnic cleansing"" practiced by the Serbs"
in Bosnia most particularly - are not only an insult to humanity but,
unfortunately, a yet unanswered challenge to the international community.
The resolution just adopted by the Council is just one measure among so
many others that we hope will be taken in the days to come. Let us, I beg,
S/PV.3217
43
(Mr, Olhave, Djibouti)
not lose sight of the fact that bringing the guilty to justice, whatever their
ethnic origin, and compensating the victims must be considered as two factors
that are indissolubly linked and are the ultimate goal of the resolution.
The right of a people to territorial integrity is sacred, the more so
because the Bosnian pluralism is deeply rooted in Bosnian soil: it cannot be
shifted and cannot, either in the south or in the north, in the east or in the
west, suffer any amputation.
That country will have its peace and its unity restored once the guns
have been silenced, the militias have been dissolved, the causes of the
conflict have been rooted out, the barriers between the regions have fallen,
when all the refugees have gone back to their homes and, lastly, when all
citizens have rallied round their State, the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Russian): I shall now make a
statement in my capacity as representative of the Russian Federation.
First of all, I should like to express my gratitude to the
Secretary-General and to his colleagues in the Secretariat, in particular
Mr. Fleischhauer, for his well-prepared report that includes the Statute of
the International Tribunal.
The Russian Federation not only supported but in fact co—sponsored the
draft resolution that establishes the International Tribunal to prosecute
those responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law
committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia since the beginning of
1991.
Today the need for this decision has become guite self-evident to us
all. This has also been shown by the fact that the need for the Tribunal to
S/PV.3217
44
(The President)
be set up quickly was noted in the joint action programme adopted on 22 May by
the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the United States, Britain, France, Spain
and Russia. Those guilty of mass crimes covered by the 1949 Geneva Protocols,
violations of the laws and customs of war, crimes of genocide and crimes
against humanity must be duly punished.
It is of particular importance that for the first time in history, it is
not the victors who are judging the vanquished, but the entire international
community that, through the Tribunal, will be passing sentence on those who
are grossly violating not only the norms of international law but even quite
simply our human concepts of morality and humanity.
We favour the establishment of the International Tribunal because we see
in it not a place for summary justice, nor a place for settling scores or for
seeking vengeance, but an instrument of justice which is called upon to
restore international legality and the faith of the world community in the
triumph of justice and reason. That is why, today, while the flames of war
continue to rage in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, where already tens
of thousands of lives have been taken, the Security Council, as the principal
organ of the United Nations responsible for the maintenance of international
peace and security, assumed, in accordance with the Charter of the United
Nations, the responsibility for implementing the appropriate specific
measures, which include the establishment of the International Tribunal.
In taking this decision to establish the International Tribunal, we are
simultaneously approving its Statute, which determines the sphere of
competence of that body, the form it work will take and the methods it will
use, the rules governing its composition and so on. In this connection, my
delegation is authorized to state the following.
S/PV.3217
45
(The President)
While believing that the text of the Statute addresses the tasks that
face the Tribunal, and for that reason supporting it, we deem it appropriate
to note that, according to our understanding, Article 5 of the Statute
encompasses criminal acts committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia
during an armed conflict - acts which were widespread or systematic, were
aimed against the civilian population and were motivated by that population's
national, political, ethnic, religious or other affiliation.
S/PV.3217
46
(The President)
While supporting the establishment of this organ of international
criminal justice for the punishment of persons guilty of having committed
serious violations of international humanitarian law on the territory of
the former Yugoslavia, we also believe that this body will not abolish nor
replace national justice organs.
As we understand it, the provisions of Article 9, paragraph 2,
denote the duty of a State to give very serious consideration to a request
by the Tribunal to refer to it a case that is being considered in a
national court. But this is not a duty automatically to refer the
proceedings to the Tribunal on such a matter. A refusal to refer the case
naturally has to be justified. We take it that this provision will be
reflected in the rules of procedure and the rules of evidence of the
Tribunal.
The establishment of the International Tribunal, apart from the
great juridical meaning of this step, is also an extremely important
political act taken by the international community which at the same time
fulfils a preventive function and also promotes the restoration of peace
in the region.	•
I now resume my functions as President of the Security Council.
There are no further speakers inscribed on my list. The Security
Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration of the
item on its agenda.
The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.
The meeting rose at 10.50 p.m.
