ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
The agenda was adopted.
THE SITUATION IN THE REPUBLIC OF BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
The PRESIDENT: I should like to inform the Council that I have
received letters from the representatives of Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria,
Argentina, Austria, Bahrain, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, the

conformity with the usual practice, I propose, with the consent of the
Council, to invite those representatives to participate in the discussion,
without the right to vote, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
Charter and rule 37 of the Council's provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.

The PRESIDENT: I have also received a request dated 19 April 1993
from Ambassador Dragomir Djokic to address the Council. With the consent of
the Council, I would propose to invite him to address the Council in the
course of its discussion of the item before it.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
I should like to inform the Council that I have received a letter dated
16 April 1993 from the representative of Turkey, which reads as follows:
”1 have the honour to request that the Security Council extend an
invitation to His Excellency Mr. Engin Ansay, Ambassador, Permanent
Observer of the Organization of the Islamic Conference to the United

procedure in the course of the Council's consideration of the item
"currently on its agenda."""
This letter has been published as document S/25615.
If I hear no objection, I shall take it that the Council agrees to extend
an invitation under rule 39 to Ambassador Ansay.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
S/PV.3201

(The President)
The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on its
agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.
The first name inscribed on the list of speakers is that of the
representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina, on whom I now call.
Mr, SACIRBEY (Bosnia and Herzegovina): I should like to commend
you, Mr. President, on the capable manner in which you have provided
leadership to the Council.
I should also like to express my appreciation to the non-aligned caucus
for its determined efforts and my admiration to its current coordinator, His
Excellency Ambassador Diego Arria, for his most capable statesmanship.
Genocide and aggression are two powerful words in any language or tone.
They convey images that shock and frighten civilized mankind. These are the
images of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina.
They also underlie powerful legal considerations. There is an obligation
on the part of the community of nations to take concrete steps to halt
immediately the actions those words represent. Obviously, that is the reason
why certain members of the Council avoid the use of these two words. It is
tragically comical how resolutions and statements are drafted that describe
the acts but so faithfully and meticulously omit the damning words. These two
words are the reality of Bosnia and Herzegovina, no matter what attempts are
made to exclude them from any resolution or statement pertaining to Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
Even the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia was co-opted
to deflect the legal implication of these words and to redefine the aggression
S/PV.3201
7
(Mr. Sacirbey,
Bosnia and Herzegovina)
and genocide against the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It became a
priority to recharacterize the problem to suit the solutions that were being
offered instead of modifying the solutions to actually address the unavoidable
problem.
Now that the Vance-Owen plan has seemingly lost its utility in masking
the failure of the international community to fulfil its obligations, those
who most promoted the plan, with authority, now find it so convenient to
betray its vision. Ironically, we, who most vividly saw the plan's flaws,
cling to it as a necessary vehicle to a brighter future.
The following is unavoidable, and efforts to avoid it have exacerbated
the problem: Serbia and Montenegro have undertaken aggression against the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The International Court of Justice has
defined it as genocide. The Security Council has failed to fulfil its
responsibility to stop the aggression and genocide.
The community of nations has come together in the United Nations and
nations have individually subjected themselves to the rule of law to secure
greater peace and security. Nations do not restrain their sovereignty to be
subjected to the political whims of the powerful in interpreting international
law selectively. A new world order cannot be defined on the basis of the
economic and strategic interests of a few.
The efforts of the non-aligned caucus and other members of the Security
Council in promoting the swift adoption of resolutions 819 (1993) and 820
(1993), and in calling for a more legally and ethically responsible answer to
genocide and aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina, are most consistent
with the soul of this noble body, the principles of international law and the
raison d'etre for restrained sovereignty.
S/PV.3201
8
(Mr, Sacirbev,
Bosnia and Herzegovina)
The Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina strongly endorses the terms of
resolution 819 (1993) in its objective to create a safe area in and around the
town of Srebrenica. We are also appreciative of the motivations of the Office
of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the United
Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in their efforts with respect to
Srebrenica.
Noije the less, we caution that military and humanitarian personnel cannot
be assigned the obligation of political decision-making. It may be a
convenient means for some members of the Security Council to avoid
responsibility, but it perverts the very principles of the United Nations.
Under its current mandate, in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina
UNPROFOR can only accommodate the stronger aggressor at the expense of the
weaker victim. The United Nations cannot be allowed to assist aggressors in
accomplishing their goals and achieving political legitimacy.
We call upon the Security Council and the Secretariat to ensure that its
directives under resolution 819 (1993) are fully implemented and enforced.
In fact, if there is deemed to be a surrender of the Bosnian forces in
Srebrenica then this is also a surrender by the United Nations to the forces
of aggression.
It has become clear that the current mandate of United Nations operations
in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina is not adequate or appropriate. We
commend and thank the brave men and women who are valiantly trying to provide
assistance under the banner of the United Nations. Tourniquets and band-aids
are an appropriate temporary response to some wounds to stop the bleeding, but
they become irrelevant when new and ever more vicious wounds are allowed to be
S/PV.32O1
9-10
(Mr, Sacirbev,
Bosnia and Herzegovina)
inflicted. Indefinitely applied, temporary assistance can become gradually
counter-productive if it is used to mask the necessity for longer-term
remedies.
We fully endorse the new draft resolution on Bosnia and Herzegovina being
introduced by the non-aligned caucus. Its provisions are the only hope for
peace or a negotiated settlement because it solely addresses the cause of the
war against our nation and can thus bring about the necessary environment for
an end to unilateral aggression.
As importantly, the following measures will in fact save lives now and in
the longer term: first, by all necessary means either take firm control of or
"neutralize heavy weapons; secondly, interdict supply lines from Serbia and"
"Montenegro penetrating our nation; and, thirdly, clarify that the arms embargo"
does not apply to the defence forces of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
If these steps are deemed to pose an unacceptable risk to currently
mandated United Nations personnel and their current mission, then the
Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina clearly requests that
such missions be appropriately modified and that such United Nations personnel
take precautionary measures, and if necessary, withdraw.
S/PV.3201
11
(Mr, Sacirbev, Bosnia and Herzegovina)
It is indeed ironic that, on the fiftieth anniversary of the Warsaw
Ghetto uprising and the betrayal of those doomed souls, another people
threatened with genocide is still awaiting the necessary response.
Genocide and aggression: efforts to evade these words are a continuing
exercise in avoidance of responsibility.
There can be no authority without responsibility.
The PRESIDENT: I thank the representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina
for his kind words addressed to me.
The next speaker is the representative of Turkey. I invite him to take a
place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr. BURCUOGLU (Turkey) (interpretation from French): It is a great
pleasure for me to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency
of the Security Council for the month of April. You are a seasoned expert in
multilateral diplomacy with a record of achievements in that field. We are
certain that under your guidance the Council will discharge its
responsibilities successfully. I must also pay a tribute to
Ambassador O'Brien of New Zealand for the outstanding way in which he guided
the work of the Council in March.
My delegation is deeply touched by the statement you made, Mr. President,
on behalf of the Council at its meeting on 17 April after the sudden death of
Mr. Turgut Ozal, President of the Republic of Turkey. We have experienced an
enormous loss. Your expressions of sympathy have been brought to the
attention of the Turkish Government and of the bereaved family of the late
President. I should like to express to you our gratitude and our most sincere
thanks for sharing the grief that has so painfully struck the Turkish
Government and people.
S/PV.3201
12
(Mr. Burcuo^lu, Turkey)
We owe this open debate first	and	foremost to you, Mr.	President, to	the
non-aligned members of the Council	and	to the Contact Group	on Bosnia and
Herzegovina of the Organization of	the	Islamic Conference.	In its letter
addressed to the President of the Security Council of 15 April 1993, issued as
document S/25607, the Contact Group requested an urgent formal meeting of the
Security Council with an open debate so that all non-members could voice their
concern and their indignation at what is going on in martyred Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
We pay a tribute to Mr. Vance and Lord Owen, Co-Chairmen of the Steering
Committee of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, for the
tireless efforts they have made. My delegation also wishes to commend the
United Nations Protection Force, the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees and the humanitarian organizations for their efforts, in extremely
difficult conditions, to help millions of people.
A State Member of the United Nations where all ethnic and religious
communities have lived for centuries in exemplary tolerance and harmony has,
for more than a year now, continued to be dismembered before the eyes of the
international community. The Muslim population is in effect being threatened
with extermination, and the Serbian aggression, the daily round of massacres
and deliberate pillage of the civilian populations, the forced relocations and
the massive violations of human rights and international humanitarian law
"continue. The monstrous Serbian campaign of ""ethnic cleansing"" and genocide"
is in full swing.
Despite the indescribable horrors his people have experience, on 25 March
President Alija Izetbegovic, on behalf of the Bosnian Government, signed the
documents of the peace plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina drawn up by the
S/PV.3201
13
(Mr, Burcuoglu, Turkey)
Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the
Former Yugoslavia. By accepting the plan in conditions of aggression and
genocide, President Izetbegovic displayed remarkable courage and showed his
sincere dedication to the search for a peaceful solution.
My delegation subscribes to the following points so rightly put forward
by the President of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in signing the
plan. Firstly, the Serbian aggressor should sign the plan within a reasonable
"time; secondly, the international community should take effective steps to"
"make sure it is implemented; and, thirdly, the aggression should cease"
immediately.
Almost four weeks have passed since the peace plan was signed by two of
the three parties, and the Serbian side is thus the only one left that has not
accepted it. During that time, the Serbian aggressors have, on several
occasions, shown that they have no intention of signing the plan and putting
an end to their chauvinistic ambitions to create a Greater Serbia. Despite
innumerable appeals by the Security Council and the international community,
"they have continued their aggression, their revolting practice of ""ethnic"
"cleansing"" and their policy of genocide. What is happening in Srebrenica is"
the most glaring example of this.
Since the beginning of the Bosnian tragedy, Turkey has been asking the
Security Council and the international community to demonstrate political
will, to take decisive measures and to make it quite clear to Belgrade and its
agents in Bosnia and Herzegovina that the Council and the international
community will shoulder their responsibilities and stand shoulder-to-shoulder
with the victims of the aggression.
Unfortunately, our appeals have not had the impact that we hoped for with
the Security Council. In fact, the Council has taken only piecemeal, timid
S/PV.3201
14
(Mr. Burcuoglu, Turkey)
steps that lacked conviction. Not only that, the measures and the sanctions
that have been imposed, instead of being applied thoroughly, have been
systematically ignored or violated. The inadequate and ineffective response
by the Security Council has beyond a doubt encouraged the Serbs to pursue
"their policy of aggression, ""ethnic cleansing"" and genocide."
Since the Council has so far been unable to take up the challenge hurled
at the international community, the number of victims is still growing and the
towns of Bosnia are falling one after another. The failure of the United
Nations in Bosnia and Herzegovina is also apparent in the heart-wrenching
appeals for help from the officials in the United Nations Protection Force,
United Nations staff members and members of the humanitarian organizations
working in the field. It is a paradox that this setback should be occurring
just when methods of strengthening and developing preventive diplomacy,
restoring peace and peace-keeping are being studied as part of the debate on
"""An Agenda for Peace""."
We should also like to emphasise our deep concern in view of a number of
harmful initiatives that, under the cover of mediation or good offices, are
playing into the hands of the Serbian aggressors, of Messrs. Milosevic and
Karadzic.
We welcome the opinion of 8 April delivered by the International Court of
Justice, which unanimously, on a provisional basis, indicates that the
Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) must
immediately, in accordance with the undertaking it had given under the
Convention on the Prevention, and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, take all
measures in its power to prevent the perpetration of the crime of genocide.
S/PV.3201
15
(Mr, Burcuoglu, Turkey)
I should like to recall, in this context, that the recommendations of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference that an international tribunal should
be established to pass judgement on those held to be responsible for serious
violations of international humanitarian law committed in the former
Yugoslavia since 1991 have been issued as document S/25512.
My delegation welcomes resolution 816 (1993) on strengthening the no-fly
zone. Although it considers it a step in the right direction, it finds it to
be too late and too little to deter the Serbian aggressors.
S/PV.3201
16
(Mr, Burcuoglu, Turkey)
Resolution 819 (1993), on Srebrenica, fits within the same context - that
is, it has good intentions and is useful but does not have binding specific
measures to ensure its application. We attach great importance to the report
of the Mission of the Council that will be visiting Bosnia and Herzegovina
under paragaraph 12 of that resolution.
Resolution 820 (1993), concerning the strengthening of the sanctions
against Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), which the Council just adopted -
on 17 April - is another important step. We regret the delay in its
implementation. Despite its good points, it is very far from responding to
the urgency of the situation since putting it into effect will necessarily
require time and there will always be risks of violations.
It is high time that the international community and the Security Council
shouldered their obligation to implement the Vance-Owen plan and make of it a
lasting solution.
To put an end to Serbian aggression and to persuade the aggressor to sign
the peace plan, more decisive action by the Security Council is required.
What we expect from the Council is the adoption of a resolution containing the
following elements: first, measures, including aerial attacks, aimed at the
"interdiction of the supply lines of the Bosnian Serb paramilitary units;"
secondly, measures designed to place the heavy weapons of all parties under
"the control of the United Nations; thirdly, if the preceding measures are not"
implemented, the lifting of the arms embaro imposed on Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Security Council has so far been unable to stop Serbian aggression.
It is in this context that Turkey has backed the conditional lifting of the
arms embargo imposed by resolution 713 (1991). We firmly believe that, in the
light of the continued horrors experienced by the Muslim population and the
continued inability of the United Nations to remedy this situation, the
S/PV.3201
17
(Mr, Burcuoglu, Turkey)
Security Council must allow the Bosnian Government/ which is in a position of
total inferiority concerning arms, to exercise its inalienable right to
self-defence against an aggressor threatening the very existence of its
people. So long as the Serbian party continues to impose its will through the
use of superior weapons, it will not be inclined to accept the peace plan. If
the Bosnian Government had the means to defend itself, that would deter the
aggressor from pursuing a policy based on the use of force and would make it
opt for peace.
For more than a year now, war has been raging in Bosnia and Herzegovina
and the conflagration is still likely to extend to other parts of the region.
At this critical moment the Security Council's credibility is being sorely
tested. We all know that mere condemnations, half-measures and ineffective
resolutions are useless. The Council's action must be commensurate with its
task. It must explicitly say to Belgrade and to the Bosnian Serbs that the
patience of the international community has run out. It must finally act
forcefully, for its timidity will encourage other possible aggressors -
indeed, examples of this are already emerging. The Council must authorize the
use of force against the aggressor before it is too late. It must demonstrate
the same determination that has been shown in other regions where the United
Nations has intervened. We hope that the present debate will help the Council
finally to take decisive measures.
Turkey remains ready to support any concerted international action
designed to put an end to the Bosnian tragedy. To follow up on this question,
Turkey is considering, with the Contact Group of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference, requesting the convening of an emergency session of the
General Assembly.
S/PV.3201
18
(Mr. Burcuoglu, Turkey)
The use of brute force must not be rewarded, and crimes committed must
not remain unpunished. Otherwise, the reputation of the Organisation and the
credibility of the Security Council will suffer greatly, and this will in turn
jeopardize the very foundations of the system of international peace and
security. If the international community and the Security Council shirk their
responsibilities at this critical moment, history will judge and condemn us
all most severely.
The PRESIDENT: I thank the representative of Turkey for the kind
words he addressed to my predecessor and to me.
The next speaker is the representative of Austria. I invite him to take
a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr. HOHENFELLNER (Austria): The unspeakable human tragedy which has
unfolded over the past few days in East Bosnia and the continuing flouting of
and utter disregard for previous decisions of the Security Council by the
Serbian side compels us to participate in this debate. Given the gravity of
the situation we are grateful to the initiators of this debate.
On 25 March President Izetbegovic signed the remaining parts of the peace
package as prepared in extensive consultations by the co-Chairmen of the
International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia. Since then, several weeks
have elapsed without acceptance by the Bosnian Serbs of the negotiated
settlement of the conflict.
On the contrary, despite intensive diplomatic efforts the Bosnian Serbs
have continued their military aggression, in particular in eastern Bosnia,
openly flouting the authority of the international community and the Security
Council.
S/PV.3201
19
(Mr, Hohenfellner, Austria)
Despite numerous demands for an effective cease-fire in Security Council
resolutions and assurances given by their leaders, the Bosnian Serb forces
have again and again resumed the fighting. The manifold condemnations of
"""ethnic cleansing"" and other violations of international humanitarian law have"
only resulted in further cruel acts of the same kind. In direct contravention
of the relevant Security Council resolutions and of all human decency, the
delivery of humanitarian assistance has been and is being hindered and
thwarted whenever it fits into the political intentions of the Bosnian Serb
leaders.
Since the ban on military flights in the airspace of Bosnia and
Herzegovina more than 500 violations have been reported by the United Nations
Protection Force (UNPROFOR). When the enforcement of the no-fly zone finally
began, the reaction of the Bosnian Serb side was the heavy shelling of
defenceless civilians in Srebrenica and Sarajevo. Thereby, it presumably
intended to demonstrate to the world and the Security Council once more its
attitude of defiance of the Council's decisions and international law.
Blatant disregard for Security Council resolutions, UNPROFOR and the Office of
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has become their
pattern of behaviour.
Regrettably, it is therefore by now obvious that a peaceful solution in
the former Yugoslavia cannot be achieved by diplomatic means alone. The time
has come for the international community to take more decisive steps,
including further measures foreseen in Chapter VII of Charter of the United
Nations.
S/PV.3201
20
(Mr, Hohenfellner, Austria)
Austria certainly welcomes the adoption of a stricter sanctions regime in
Security Council resolution 820. However, given the pressing needs in Bosnia
and Herzegovina, the Security Council should urgently take effective and
vigorous actions to bring about implementation of existing Security Council
resolutions as well as of the decisions of the London Conference.
Daily the media overwhelm us with reports on unspeakable human suffering
in Srebrenica. Constantly we are confronted with pictures showing the cruel
consequences of systematic harassment, deprivation and torture. We commend
the activities of UNPROFOR and UNHCR as well as the air-drops to help these
desperate people. But, to assuage our conscience, does it suffice to achieve
"the minimizing of the number of casualties in the further progress of ""ethnic"
"cleansing""."
S/PV.3201
21
(Mr. Hohenfellner, Austria^
As early as last summer, the Foreign Minister of Austria proposed the
establishment of safe areas in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The case of Srebrenica
has once again shown the urgent need to create such areas. It should be our
first priority to protect innocent civilians against murder, fighting,
"starvation and cold, and to attempt to prevent further ""ethnic cleansing"" in"
those protected areas. Austria therefore considers Security Council
resolution 819 (1993) an important first step. Now a sufficient number of the
United Nations Protection Forces (UNPROFOR) troops in the Srebrenica area and
an active and effective protection of the civilian population in and around
Srebrenica are a matter of the utmost priority. Additional safe areas should
be created in and around Sarajevo, Gorazde and other densely populated areas
which are controlled by the Government and are under pressure from the Bosnian
Serb army.
The international community cannot accept the continuous hindrance of
humanitarian relief efforts by the Bosnian Serbs. Another step urgently
required, therefore, is the full implementation of resolution 770 (1992),
which authorizes all necessary measures to be taken to facilitate the delivery
of humanitarian assistance. In particular, corridors under the protection of
UNPROFOR should be established for the unhindered delivery of humanitarian
assistance.
Furthermore, the Security Council should take concrete steps to resolve
the problem of the unabated use of heavy weapons, as foreseen at the London
Conference. The incessant and senseless shelling of Bosnian towns, such as
Sarajevo, makes this a priority issue.
"Security Council resolution 819 (1993) ""Demands that the Federal Republic"
of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) immediately cease the supply of military
S/PV.3201
22
(Mr. Hohenfellner, Austria)
"arms, equipment and services"" (para, 3) to the Bosnian Serb forces in Bosnia"
and Herzegovina. An important measure to bring about implementation of this
crucial demand would be the deployment of United Nations observers on the
border between the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), as already mentioned in Security
Council resolution 787 (1992) last December.
The international community cannot risk failure in its efforts to achieve
peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. If the Bosnian Serb side is not ready to
sign and honour the peace plan, to fulfil the relevant Security Council
resolutions and to abide by international humanitarian law, it must be induced
to do so by applying all necessary means foreseen in the United Nations
Charter, including Chapter VII. To do otherwise would mean failing to uphold
international law and all other basic principles to which we have agreed.
Furthermore, it would be a fallacy to believe that this is a conflict which
can be left to burn out. On the contrary - if aggression and violence were
allowed to stand in Bosnia and Herzegovina, they could become a firebrand
spilling over into other parts of the former Yugoslavia and indeed into other
areas of the region as a whole, continuously refuelling itself. The time has
come to take a decisive stand. What is needed now, above all, is to put the
decisions and resolutions already adopted by the international community into
effect and not to add new decisions which would remain dead letters. Only
thus will the United Nations be in a position to fulfil its task of restoring
"peace and international security; otherwise its credibility might suffer"
further.
"The PRESIDENT; The next speaker is the representative of Malaysia."
I invite him to take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
S/PV.3201
23
Mr. RAZALI (Malaysia) : Allow me to join others in extending my
delegation's congratulations to you, Sir, on your being President of the
Council for this month. May I also congratulate Ambassador Terence O'Brien of
New Zealand for the sterling work he performed last month with great skill and
great effort.
Today's meeting may have mixed motives, since there have been weeks of
opposition from certain members for a formal debate. My delegation hopes that
our meeting today is related to the terrible plight of Srebrenica and the
implication of its possible fall in terms of the Council's reputation and
effectiveness and of the many thousands who will suffer. While Malaysia
welcomes the recent adoption of resolution 820 (1993) by the Council on the
tightening of economic sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(Serbia and Montenegro), we regret that the sanctions measures are not
comprehensive enough given that the Serbian aggression against Bosnia has been
going on for more than a year. Our main concern is that the tightening of
sanctions under resolution 820 (1993) will not have the immediate effect of
protecting the Bosnian Muslims from continuing Serbian heavy bombardments on
civilian centres, particularly Sarajevo and Bihac, and will still leave
Bosnian Muslims vulnerable to Serbian attacks and interruptions of United
Nations relief supplies to other areas.
The desperate situation on the ground in Bosnia calls for effective and
concrete action to be taken by the Council as a matter of urgency. In this
regard, Malaysia would like to urge the Council to take the following
"measures: placing heavy weaponry under United Nations control; the creation"
of safe havens which, among other things, would require steps to stop Serbian
"bombardments and ensure the free and uninterrupted flow of relief supplies;"
"interdiction of the supply lines of the Serbian forces in Bosnia; and the"
S/PV.3201
24
(Mr, Razali, Malaysia)
lifting of the arms embargo with respect to the Government of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter.
These are not new proposals. They are contained in General Assembly
resolutions 46/242 of 25 August 1992 and 47/121 of 18 December 1992. In
addition, the caucus of non-aligned members has been asking the Council to
consider such measures for the last several weeks, and the Malaysian
delegation would like to express its deep appreciation to the non-aligned
caucus for its efforts.
The Malaysian delegation would like to take this opportunity to express
its serious concern over the actions of certain Council members in obstructing
repeated desperate requests for emergency meetings of the Council to address
the growing deterioration of the situation in Bosnia. Those actions are
tantamount to applying a surreptitious veto. We are also disheartened that
the Council succumbed to positions taken by certain of its permanent members
that delayed the adoption by the Security Council of both resolutions
816 (1993), on the enforcement of no-fly zones, and 820 (1993), on economic
sanctions.
As regards the peace plan, while reluctantly recognizing its significant
shortcomings, Malaysia accepts the view of the Secretary-General, stated in
his report in document S/25479, that:
"""The Co-Chairmen's peace package provides the only mechanism available"
for the re-establishment of peace, with justice and respect for human
"rights, in Bosnia and Herzegovina"". (S/25479, para 30)"
However, we question the status of the plan now with two parties signing and
the continued rejection by the Bosnian Serbs and the continuing rampage of the
Serbs. The Council must clearly manifest its resolute will to ensure by all
S/PV.3201
25
(Mr, Razali, Malaysia)
necessary means acceptance of the plan by the Serbian side. Half-hearted
measures would amount to acquiescence to the Serbian onslaught.
At the same time, the question looms ever larger over the continued
unwillingness on the part of the Council to take more resolute measures and to
respect General Assembly resolutions 46/242 and 47/121. As long as the
Council remains in such a state, the Serbs will roll on in ruthless pursuit of
a perverse grand design for a Greater Serbia. My delegation understands how
unready the United Nations is for the necessary tasks in Bosnia. In upholding
the rule of law within the framework of collective security, the United
Nations, in concert and with universally accepted premises, would readily
raise united armies to enforce its decisions and punish perpetrators such as
those that are now committing atrocities in Bosnia.
S/PV.3201
26
(Mr, Razali, Malaysia)
The United Nations may yet take some years to develop such an approach to
collective security, but events do not choose opportune moments to present
challenges, and the Council cannot allow the views of a few to determine when
it should act while Bosnians continue to be slaughtered. Ready or not, the
Council is confronted with the Bosnian situation now. We are witnessing
crimes against humanity being committed by the Serbs that threaten to blot out
the gains accrued from the end of the cold war, from a revitalized United
Nations and from the emerging consensus on values that govern States and
societies. What adds to further cynicism is the fact that when women,
children, innocent civilians and refugees of Srebrenica were being bombarded
by the Serbs, necessary actions were held back for political consolidation
reasons elsewhere.
As the Council's effectiveness remains in question, my delegation has no
choice but to use this debate to direct our appeal to the United States, both
its Government and its people, to help Bosnia. My delegation finds no
assurance in the actions of Europe. That region is undergoing a grave revival
of ethnic strife, intolerance and conflict that threatens Europe's own
"standards. By refusing to support military action against Serbian ""ethnic"
"cleansing"", the Europeans are in danger of allowing a revival of appeasement"
and genocide. The former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Lady Thatcher,
recently excoriated current European leaders for their impassivity.
Furthermore, Europe has not only been unable to decide in concert to stop the
atrocities, but would appear to have been obstructing the possible role of
others, including that of the United States.
S/PV.3201
27
(Mr. Razali, Malaysia)
The situation in Bosnia, whatever the original causes, must now be seen
solely as deliberate actions designed to forge together a Greater Serbia
territory by any number of killings, rape and other forms of brutalization.
"The Council has to act to stop the further expansion of the ""killing fields""."
The Council cannot remain in analysis paralysis, deaf to the chorus of dying
voices seeking help. If there is ever any clear role and responsibility for
the United States to lead in the Council it is now - to provide a lifeline to
the suffering Bosnians, whatever it takes. There is general acceptance that
now only the United States can galvanize the Council into action that can save
the Bosnians from extermination. The United States is right in expecting
support from the international community for selective enforcement actions in
Bosnia. Malaysia, and I am sure many of the Members of the international
community, stand ready to play their part and join the United States in a
United Nations collective enforcement action.
If, under certain circumstances, the Council is still unable to act, then
the time will come for the Members of the United Nations to consider working
towards a Uniting-for-Peace resolution at a special session of the General
Assembly.
The PRESIDENT: I thank the representative of Malaysia for the kind
words he addressed to my predecessor and to me.
The next speaker is the representative of Senegal. I invite him to take
a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr, CISSE (Senegal) (interpretation from French): You are presiding
over the Security Council at a time when this body is facing a resurgence of
tragedy in the world. Your well-known wisdom and reputation as an even-handed
diplomat guarantee that you will guide our discussions successfully.
S/PV.3201
28
(Mr, Cisse, Senegal)
Allow me also at this time to congratulate your predecessor,
Ambassador O'Brien of New Zealand, on the brilliantly effective manner in
which he directed the work of the Security Council last month.
If this were once again a matter of taking the floor to denounce the
tragedy which slowly but inexorably has been wiping Bosnia-Herzegovina off the
map, the Council can rest assured that the Senegalese delegation would have
been glad to refrain from speaking. All that has already been said by us and
by other delegations. We have shared with you the concerns of the President
of the Republic of Senegal, Mr. Abdou Diouf, the current President of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, as to what is happening in that State
Member of our Organization.
My purpose today, therefore, is not to offer lamentations but rather to
express astonishment and make proposals - astonishment at our culpable
inefficacy and proposals for the Council at long last to take steps to save
what can still be saved.
As we see it, what needs to he emphasized today is that nearly a month
ago, on 25 March 1993, Mr. Alija Izetbegovic, President of the Presidency of
Bosnia-Herzegovina, acting on behalf of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina
signed the documents bearing on the Vance-Owen Peace Plan, thus accepting the
plan in toto.
That courageous decision, taken at a difficult time in the history of the
people of Bosnia - who, though manifestly the victims of certain parties to
the said accord, are accepting it in spirit and in letter - demonstrates how
deeply committed they are to the quest for peace. The tragic irony of fate
now is that circumstances are rewarding those who are refusing to sign that
plan viewed by its advocates as the only recourse for restoring peace. In
S/PV.3201
29-30
(Mr. Cisse, Senegal)
fact, the response of the Serbian side to the peace efforts is common
knowledge. It is in fact a non-response, if not a demonstration of contempt
for the international community.
We deeply regret that the ineffectve and notoriously inadequate sanctions
imposed by the Security Council and the unanimous but not very tangible
condemnation by the international community should have led only to an
intensification of the acts of aggression by the Serb forces and the
"acquisition by force of more and more territory. Today, ""ethnic cleansing"" is"
all but complete. Srebrenica resounds in our consciences as the cry
signalling the end.
The contemptuous reaction of Serbia-Montenegro to Security Council
resolution 819 (1993) has triggered our anger as it has that of the Council
and, in less than 24 hours, the Council has responded by adopting a new
resolution 820 (1993) so as at last to stiffen the sanctions against the
Serbs. And yet we are not thereby reassured that the Serbs will obey the
Council's injunctions. They have, after all, got us used to their flouting of
the Council's resolutions.
It is high time, therefore, that the Security Council got a grip on
itself and took other measures - measures of the kind that will make the
Council credible in the eyes of millions of human beings carefully following
its deliberations.
S/PV.3201
31
(Mr, Cisse, Senegal)
It is from that perspective that we appeal to the Council to adopt the
following measures, which it owes to the suffering people of Bosnia and
Herzegovina: first, immediate implementation of the strict economic and
financial sanctions put in place by resolutions 757 (1992), 787 (1992) and 820
"(1993); secondly, effective implementation of the provisions of resolution"
752 (1992) on placing heavy weapons under monitoring and the cutting of the
"Serb militias' supply lines; and thirdly, the lifting of the arms embargo"
imposed against Bosnia and Herzegovina, for experience has shown clearly that
the effects of this measure taken against the belligerent parties harm only
the Bosnian side. Lifting the embargo would enable the victim of aggression
to secure the means to exercise its right of self-defence under Article 51 of
the Charter.
Those measures may not be new ideas, but they are none the less urgently
necessary in the present circumstances.
The PRESIDENT: I thank the representative of Senegal for the kind
words he addressed to my predecessor and to me.
The next speaker is the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
/ ■
I invite him to take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr, KHARRAZI (Islamic Republic of Iran): At the outset, Sir, I
should like to take this opportunity to offer my sincere congratulations to
you, a distinguished diplomat from the brotherly and friendly country of
Pakistan, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for
this month. Allow me also to express my sincere gratitude and appreciation to
you for the prompt consideration of the request of a number of delegations.
S/PV.3201
32
(Mr, Kharrazi, Islamic
Republic of Iran)
including my own, for the convening of this meeting to consider urgently the
tragic situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I am confident that your skill
and vast diplomatic experience will enable you effectively to guide the
Council's deliberations on this important subject.
I should like also to extend my gratitude to your predecessor, the
Permanent Representative of New Zealand, Ambassador O'Brien, and his able
delegation for a valuable and lucid performance as President last month.
The Security Council meets today to discuss an issue which continues
thoroughly to shock the conscience of every human being. For more than a year
tens of thousands of innocent Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina have been
subjected to wholesale uprooting, mass rape and systematic murder by Serbs.
It is high time we asked ourselves why the Security Council did not act
resolutely and in time in the face of this clear and blatant Serbian
aggression. An overwhelming majority of Member States believes that the
Council has not shouldered its responsibilities with regard to safeguarding
the territorial integrity of a State Member of the United Nations. The
Security Council has had ample opportunity to reverse the aggression, but the
fact of the matter is that rhe Council has always acted passively and
belatedly regarding the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The evidence is enormous. When the Serbs started their aggression
against Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Council neither confronted the aggression
nor took any action to enable the Bosnian Government to exercise its inherent
right of individual or collective self-defence in accordance with the
Charter. When the Council adopted its resolution 781 (1992) banning all
S/PV.3201
33
(Mr, Kharrazi, Islamic
Republic of Iran)
military flights over Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Serbs continued to disregard
that Council decision. The Security Council therefore had to adopt another
resolution to enforce resolution 781 (1992). Faced with Serbian
intransigence, the Security Council adopted resolution 757 (1992) calling for
a sort of partial economic sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro. But the
other day the Council had to adopt another resolution to tighten the sanctions
in order to remedy the shortcomings and close the loopholes of the first
resolution.
Had the Security Council acted resolutely and expeditiously when the
"Serbs started their aggression, the abhorrent policy of ""ethnic cleansing"","
the killing and torture of defenceless people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the
mass deportation of civilians, the systematic rape of thousands of women and
the gradual annihilation and extinction of a State Member of the United
Nations could have been avoided. Moreover, in that case there was no need to
negotiate with an aggressor, a process which has resulted in that aggressor's
intransigence.
In fact, the Security Council has not followed a consistent line when
faced with different instances of aggression. Fair enough: the Council acted
promptly in the case of the occupation of Kuwait. But a policy of appeasement
and leniency’towards aggressors was adopted in the case of Bosnia and that of
Iraq's aggression against Iran.
It is with profound indignation and outrage that we see the Serbs
continuing with impunity their aggression against a young Member of the United
Nations. The ever deteriorating situation of the people of Bosnia and
S/PV.3201
34-35
(Mr. Kharrazi, Islamic
Republic of Iran)
Herzegovina and the ever widening scope of the atrocities committed against
them warrant urgent action by the Security Council to reverse this ominous
trend. The Security Council must bolster its actions in this regard with, a
meaningful enforcement mechanism and with serious political will. Indeed,
numerous resolutions and statements of the Security Council calling for a
cease-fire and an end to hostilities have invariably regrettably gone unheedecl
by the Serbs.
The essence of the matter here is that the Serbs will never voluntarily
"reverse their abhorrent campaign of ""ethnic cleansing"" or abandon their goal"
of creating a Greater Serbia. That can be easily surmised from their
genocidal behaviour. They have even exploited the peace-process negotiations
"as a cover for their insolent practice of ""ethnic cleansing"" and in order to"
ward off any pressure by the international community.
With none of the weapons they need to counter the Serbian aggression in
the hands of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and with the Security
Council discounting any talk of lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia and
Herzegovina, the Serbs are now gearing up for a final assault on surrounded
areas in that country. The intensification of daily Serbian acts of
aggression and barbarism against the defenceless people of Bosnia and
Herzegovina appears to herald a Serbian attempt quite soon to overrun
completely a State Member of the United Nations.
S/PV.3201
36
(Mr, Kharrazi, Islamic
Republic of Iran)
Under such alarming circumstances, and in the absence of any evidence
that the Serbs are inclined even to think about stopping their atrocities, it
is plausible to conclude that no argument can justify the continuation of the
arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Islamic Republic of Iran,
which has spared no effort to alleviate the agonies of the innocent and
defenceless people of Bosnia and Herzegovina through rendering humanitarian
assistance, has emphasized on numerous occasions that the Security Council,
morally, legally and politically, is duty bound to allow a nation whose
existence is at stake to defend itself. In this connection it is noteworthy
to recall that during its forty-seventh session the General Assembly adopted
resolution 47/121, which reaffirmed the right of Bosnia and Herzegovina to
self-defence. This resolution, which represents the collective will of the
majority of States Members of the United Nations, underscores, among other
things, the necessity of lifting the arms embargo against the Republic of
Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to secure its inherent prerogative to defend
itself as well as to restore its sovereignty, territorial integrity and
political independence.
When the Islamic countries first advocated the lifting of the arms
embargo against the Repiblic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, their idea was
rejected immediately by certain countries that claimed to know the Balkans
better. Now that the idea of lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia and
Herzegovina is supported more and more, those countries should answer this
critical question: Is there a legal and moral justification for the
continuation of the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina? It should be
clear by now that the Serbs will not heed the international call to stop the
aggression and that the adoption of any resolution by the Security Council,
S/PV.3201
37
(Mr, Kharrazi, Islamic
Republic of Iran)
short of lifting the arms embargo, will only make the Serbs believe that, for
the time being, resolute action is not on the horizon.
The aggressors have proven that they continue to understand the language
of force alone. If many countries and the Co-Chairmen of the Steering
Committee of the International Conference view the use of force against the
aggressors as a genuine and effective way to confront the Serbs, why are
certain members of the Council still resisting the implementation of justice?
In the light of the foregoing, and in order to remedy its past mistakes,
the Security Council should not limit its actions to the mere adoption of
resolution 820 (1993). Therefore, the Security Council in the view of many
delegations, including my own, must adopt the following immediately: first,
take measures to interdict the supply lines of Serbian paramilitary units in
"Bosnia and Herzegovina; secondly, neutralize the heavy weaponry besieging"
cities and killing civilians and enforce measures to place this weaponry under
"international control; thirdly, reaffirm its support for the Government and"
the people of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the exercise of their
inherent right to self-defence and the lifting of the arms embargo against
"this Republic; fourthly, enforce its resolution 770 (1992) expeditiously in"
order to guarantee the delivery of humanitarian assistance to all parts of
"Bosnia and Herzegovina; and, fifthly, establish immediately the international"
war-crimes tribunal for the prosecution of persons responsible for serious
violations of international humanitarian law on the basis of provisions
envisaged in resolution 808 (1993).
The PRESIDENT: I thank the representative of the Islamic Republic
of Iran for his kind words addressed to my predecessor and to me.
The next name inscribed on the list of speakers is that of the
S/PV.3201
38
(The President)
representative of Indonesia. I invite him to take a place at the Council
table and to make his statement.
Mr, SOEGARDA (Indonesia): I should like, at the outset, to extend
my delegation's congratulations, Sir, upon your assumpiton of the presidency
of the Council for this month. We remain fully confident that, with your
extensive experience and diplomatic skills, our deliberations will be brought
to a successful conclusion.
I also wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to Ambassador O'Brien of New
Zealand for the able guidance he provided to the Council last month.
Let me also avail myself of this occasion to express our appreciation to
you. Sir, and the other members of the Council for giving us the opportunity
to participate in this debate.
It is with a profound sense of sorrow and anguish that my delegation is
addressing this meeting as the people of Bosnia are being subjected to the
darkest moment in their history. At this critical juncture, therefore, the
international community is duty bound to take immediate and resolute action
not only to end the unspeakable suffering of the people but also to forestall
attempts to dismember a nation.
For the past year, Indonesia, as a non-aligned country, has noted with
grave concern the tragic chain of events that have engulfed the newly
independent Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We have followed daily
reports of escalating violence, the relentless bombardment of cities and
towns, mounting casualties, the deadly manoeuvres to starve people into
submission, forced expulsions, and, worst of all, the unconscionable policy of
"""ethnic cleansing"". The catastrophic dimension of the situation is fully"
S/PV.3201
39-40
(Mr, Soegarda, Indonesia)
evident in the horrendous loss of innocent human lives, massive violations of
human rights, the devastation of the country and the unending flight of
refugees.
Reflecting the grave concern of the international community, both the
United Nations Secretary-General and the European Community have, since the
eruption of the conflict, sought to achieve a cease-fire so as to create an
atmosphere conducive to reaching a negotiated settlement. Likewise, we placed
our confidence in this body, which adopted numerous resolutions. Thus, the
embargo on weapons, the imposition of economic sanctions, the ban on military
flights over Bosnian airspace and the decision to facilitare the delivery of
humanitarian aid represent important first steps towards the adoption of more
effective measures to end the conflict. It was the justifiable expectation of
the Member States that those measures would suffice to deter aggression and
halt genocide and forceful land-grabbing. It is most regrettable to note,
however, that despite these intense diplomatic efforts, the situation in
Bosnia has markedly worsened. My delegation, therefore, fully shares the
international outrage at the unabated aggression against the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of a State Member of this Organization and at the
continuing violence and bloodshed.

State, with most governing functions to be carried out by the provinces.
But it is undeniable that the plan offers the Bosnians the agony of
dismemberment of their country. The fragmentation of the country will not
reflect geographic, historical, demographic or economic realities. It rewards
"""ethnic cleansing"" by assigning to Serbs areas that they seized after driving"
out the other communities. Hence it is unfair to Bosnian Muslims and unduly
rewards the Bosnian Serbs. It lacks a mechanism that would compel Serbs to
comply, and it represents an enforced compromise between aggressors and their
victims.
Yet, despite grave misgivings and scepticism concerning the plan's
efficacy and feasibility, the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina accepted
the proposals in the cause of peace and saving lives. Its contemptuous
rejection by the Serbs is clearly a blatant attempt to divide Bosnia along
ethnic lines and thereby create States-within-a-State, taking them closer to
their proclaimed goal of an independent Bosnian Serbian State that will join
up with the former Yugoslavia to form a Greater Serbia.
Such insidious designs could succeed only by means of the policy of
enforced population transfers that has already been condemned by the
international community. To let the policy succeed would be tantamount not
only to undermining the stability of the region but also to igniting an
already dangerous situation in Bosnia.
S/PV.3201
42
(Mr, Soeqarda, Indonesia)
The most urgent need is for the prevention of more bloodshed and loss of
life, and for the reinforcement of existing humanitarian operations. Any
further interference with relief convoys should not be tolerated. Military
attacks on civilians, as well as the siege of Sarajevo and other cities and
towns, must cease forthwith. These should be followed by the dispatch of
additional peace-keeping forces to secure safe havens for refugees and to
facilitate the surrender of heavy weapons.
Indonesia is firmly committed to the peaceful settlement of conflicts.
We believe that a renewal of dialogue is essential for this crisis to be
resolved, and that a negotiated solution within the framework of the
appropriate international mechanism is still within reach.
A year after the eruption of hostilities and 10 months after the
imposition of embargoes, there is scant evidence that sanctions have brought
about any of the intended results. Consequently, the Serbs have become
increasingly brazen and increasingly contemptuous of those who are trying to
end the carnage. This body can no longer remain passive in the face of
defiance and the flouting of the international

S/PV.3201
43
(Mr, Soeqarda, Indonesia)
Over and above the foregoing, however, the Council should unequivocally
support the call by the President of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Mr. Izetbegovic,
for the inclusion in the peace plan of a timetable and provisions for its
"enforcement; a single constitution for the entire country; the control of"
"Bosnia's borders by its central Government; and an undivided Sarajevo as the"
capital. These measures should be buttressed in future negotiations by the
transfer of power from the provinces to the central Government.
The international community has missed far too many opportunities to
prevent the intensification and deepening of the conflict in Bosnia. For
months, only half-hearted measures were taken. The adoption of resolution
820 (1993) is eloquent testimony to members' determination to re-establish the
rule of law in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
"The PRESIDENT; I thank the representative of Indonesia for his kind"
words addressed to my predecessor and to me.
The next is the representative of Sweden. I invite him to take a place
at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr. OSVALD (Sweden): Sweden appreciates this opportunity to
participate in the Security Council's debate on the situation in Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
I think we are all painfully aware of the extremely grave and steadily
worsening humanitarian situation on the ground, in particular in places such
as Sarajevo and Srebrenica, where the shelling and destruction carried out by
the Serbian forces is taking an appalling toll of the civilian population.
The senseless killing and maiming of defenceless civilians in besieged cities,
added to the atrocities that have been carried out for more than a year now,
are totally unacceptable. Not only are communities where Serbs, Croats and
S/PV.3201
44
(Mr, Osvald, Sweden)
"Muslims used to live side by side now falling apart; the credibility of our"
common ideals is also fast unravelling as the international community has
seemed unable to take decisive political decisions to stop the war in Bosnia
and Herzegovina from reaching even more unimaginable levels of savagery and
destruction.
We are obviously not unaware of some of the problems that in past weeks
have prevented the Security Council from taking stronger action in relation to
Serbian recalcitrance about accepting current peace efforts. It is only to be
hoped that the decisions taken over the weekend, prompted by alarming events
in and around Srebrenica, signal a firmer intention to uphold the authority of
the Council and to act decisively in a case as exceedingly grave as that which
now confronts us in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
It is true that the Security Council has taken a number of measures in
the 33 resolutions on the conflict in the former Yugoslavia that it has
adopted up to now. As far as Bosnia and Herzegovina is concerned, I should
particularly like to stress the decisions that enabled a major humanitarian
relief operation to be carried out by keeping the airport at Sarajevo open and
by protecting the distribution of relief supplies throughout the country.
This operation is a significant United Nations achievement under extremely
difficult conditions.
Sweden supports the Vance-Owen plan, which has been negotiated within the
framework of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia. Allow me,
in this context, to pay a particular tribute to Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, and
all their collaborators, for their tireless efforts.
Lasting peace in the region must be based on the principles laid down in
the peace plan, and on the concept of Bosnia and Herzegovina as an independent
S/PV.3201
45
(Mr, Osvald, Sweden)
State. Even if no plan can be ideal under present circumstances, the
Vance-Owen proposal takes into account the concerns of the parties to a
sufficient degree.
If the war is allowed ,to continue, the peace plan as now envisaged could
rapidly lose its relevance. The fighting flaring up regularly between Bosnian
Croat and Muslim forces, including during the last few days around Vitez, is
of considerable concern.
Today it is of the utmost importance that the Bosnian Serbs follow the
example set by the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Croats and sign the
peace agreement immediately. By failing to sign the peace agreement and by
continuing, at the same time, their shelling against civilians and their
"""ethnic cleansing"", for example in Sarajevo and Srebrenica, Serbs bear a"
tremendous responsibility for the human suffering that is now taking place.
The regime in Belgrade as well as the Bosnian Serbs must realize this.
S/PV.3201
46
(Mr, Osvald, Sweden)
Only Serb acceptance of the peace plan and the ending of military
aggression will create conditions for avoiding total isolation of Serbia and
the eventual lifting of sanctions. In order to induce the Serbs to sign the
remaining parts of the peace agreement, Sweden supports the further
strengthening of sanctions decided upon by the Council and will work for their
full implementation in the context of the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe (CSCE).
The support which is brought to the efforts of the International
Conference on the former Yugoslavia by the CSCE follow three parallel lines of
action. Together, they comprise the strategy of supportive action by the
"CSCE:	first, crisis containment and prevention of its spillover to new areas;"
"secondly, efforts to counteract crimes of war and violations of human rights;"
and, thirdly, support of the implementation and coordination of the United
Nations sanctions regime. These efforts will be further strengthened in
pursuance of Security Council resolution 820 (1993).
Sweden for its part does not believe that the arms embargo against Bosnia
and Herzegovina should be lifted. We strongly doubt that more weapons could
contribute to peace in that war-torn country. It is much more likely to lead
to a further escalation of violence and destruction.
It is true that in the present circumstances there are arguments for not
denying the defenders the weapons they need for their self-defence. However,
in the view of my Government, the response of the international community
should be to take on the responsibility of ensuring compliance with the
resolutions of the Security Council. This, in our view, would be the better
means of ending further fighting and further human suffering. In that light,
S/PV.3201
47
(Mr. Osvald, Sweden))
continued Serb defiance, such as that already voiced by Mr. Karadzic and
Mr. Mladic, may well make international selective military action against
Serbian military targets unavoidable.
If and when a peace agreement for Bosnia and Herzegovina is signed by all
the parties concerned, the Members of the United Nations must accept the
responsibility of contributing to an international peace-keeping force under
United Nations command. This force will be required to monitor compliance
with the agreement, thus establishing a basis for a lasting peace in the
region. Sweden is prepared to contribute to such a force.
International relief measures must be strengthened, in an effort to
alleviate the needs and suffering of the civilian population. The rest of the
world cannot stand by and watch the humanitarian disaster which is now taking
place in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Increased contributions are imperative.
The international community has a duty, furthermore, to ensure that those
responsible for crimes such as indiscriminate shelling of surrounded towns and
"cities, mass rape and ""ethnic cleansing"" should be prosecuted as soon as"
possible by the international war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia
established by the Security Council.
The PRESIDENT: The next speaker is the representative of Slovenia.
I invite him to take a place at the Council table and to make his - statement.
Mr. TURK (Slovenia): May I begin, Sir, by emphasizing how pleased
we are to see you in the presidency of the Security Council. We are convinced
that under your guidance the work of the Council will be successful. We are
also grateful to Ambassador Terence O'Brien of New Zealand for his tireless
and successful work as the President of the Security Council in the month of
March.

(Mr, Turk, Slovenia)
The Security Council is meeting today to discuss the war in Bosnia and
Herzegovina and to contemplate further measures necessary for the restoration
and maintenance of international peace and security.
The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in particular its eastern
part, has deteriorated very considerably over the past few weeks. This has
necessarily, among other things, heightened what is expected of the Security
Council. More than ever before, it is clear that action, or inaction, by the
Security Council will have a decisive bearing upon the questions of life and
death - namely, questions of, first, the existence - or extinction - of a
"United Nations Member State; and, secondly, the survival - or genocidal"
extermination - of a people: the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Last Saturday, the Security Counckil started to act with vigour and
determination by adopting its resolution on additional sanctions against
Serbia and Montenegro. Now there is a need to demonstrate persistence and
commitment to the cause of real peace.
The key question is this: will the current debate actually result in
meaningful further action? The stakes are high indeed, for - as a prominent
commentator emphasized in a powerful opinion published recently - the
unpunished aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina has put the whole moral
foundation of the United Nations in jeopardy.
One thing is clear: The need for action by the international community
is becoming more and more compelling, and traditional rationalizations for
insufficient action - including those which describe the war in Bosnia and
Herzegovina as a civil war or ethnic conflict arising from centuries-old
hatreds - simply will not do. It is necessary that the war in Bosnia and
Herzegovina be finally recognized for what it really is: a war of aggression,
S/PV.3201
49
(Mr, Turk, Slovenia)
"a war for territory fought with ferocious brutality. ""Ethnic cleansing"""
committed by Serbs against others in Bosnia is a deliberate method and not a
side effect of that war.
Security Council resolution 820 (1993) represents a step in the right
direction. Slovenia supports that resolution and joins all other Members of
the United Nations in the efforts to implement it.
On the other hand, we are also aware of the need to give further thought
to pursuing the resolution's operative paragraph 8, concerning the measures
for the implementation of peace, particularly in case the Vance-Owen peace
plan is not accepted by all parties or if it is accepted in bad faith.
The Foreign Minister of Slovenia, Mr. Lojze Peterle, made a specific
proposal on 8 April 1993 for peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It will be
recalled that the proposal was communicated to the Foreign Ministers of all
States members of the Security Council and to the Secretary-General. The
essence of the proposal is expressed in the following four points - and I
quote from the letter from the Foreign Ministers
"""1. The United Nations Security Council should immediately send its"
peace-keeping forces to those areas that are under the control of the
parties who have accepted the Vance-Owen peace plan and in which there
are no major military activities. It is of special importance to deploy
peace-keeping forces on the territories still under Muslim control.
"""2. For the protection and defence of these areas, the"
international communit/ would have to provide the necessary means,
including military force. Should all three parties accept the peace
plan, these areas without military activities would have to be
demilitarized.
S/PV.3201
50
(Mr. Turk, Slovenia)
"""3. For the maintenance of peace in the protected areas, additional"
United Nations peace-keeping forces may be required.
"""4. It may be necessary that the Security Council issue a warning"
to all parties to the conflict that those who decline to cooperate in
this endeavour will be subject to the possible use of all available means
"stipulated by the United Nations Charter."""
The main thrust of the proposal advanced by the Slovenian Foreign	.
Minister is clear: immediate deployment of the United Nations peace-keeping
forces in the territories controlled by the parties which have accepted the
Vance-Owen peace plan. There are several reasons which support that line of
action.
S/PV.3201
51
(Mr, Turk, Slovenia)
First, the troops would be deployed in areas in which United Nations
protection is accepted and appreciated. Secondly, the troops would have a
preventive role as a deterrent to further acts of aggression. Thirdly, such
deployment would provide an opportunity to develop a more robust mandate of
the peace-keeping force in Bosnia and Herzegovina in accordance with actual
needs. Fourthly, the proposed action is compatible with the existing
humanitarian missions and complements them. Moreover, such an approach would
"also be compatible with the enforcement of the ""no-fly regime"" over Bosnia and"
Herzegovina and with all other types of enforcement action. This afternoon we
have heard a number of proposals to that effect - should the Security Council
authorize appropriate enforcement actions.
It is particularly important that further action by the Council is not
made contingent upon agreement of the Serbs to the Vance-Owen plan. There has
been enough waiting. It is important that further action not be made
contingent upon the actual cooperation of the Serbs in the realization of the
peace plan.	.
A renewed effort for the protection of Bosnia and Herzegovina, perhaps
along the lines proposed by the Foreign Minister of Slovenia, could serve the
genuinely humanitarian purpose of preventing further genocidal action and
would decisively help to keep the Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina and
preserve that United Nations member State. Let us be very clears Without
Bosnian Muslims, there is no Bosnia and Herzegovina. And let me also add that
the preservation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is a vital prerequisite for
stability and peace in the Balkans and in the larger area of Europe.
While pointing out the need for vigorous and focused action by the United
Nations Security Council, we by no means underestimate the need for a
comprehensive approach. The requirements of coherence and credibility call
S/PV.3201
52
(Mr. Turk, Slovenia)
for a consistent policy of the United Nations and all its organs with respect
to the fact that the former Yugoslavia has ceased to exist and that it has
been replaced by five successor States. In fact, even the use of the name
Yugoslavia by one of those successor States is apparently misleading and has
created an obstacle to finding political solutions. We have to insist on the
principle that none of the successor States of the former Yugoslavia could be
granted automatic membership in the United Nations. We plead with the members
of the Security Council to be faithful to this principle, as formulated in
resolution 777 (1992) adopted by the Security Council in September 1992, and
to insist, as envisaged in that resolution, that Serbia and Montenegro should
apply for membership of the United Nations and that it fulfil the criteria of
Article 4 of the United Nations Charter.
In the present statement we have concentrated on the essential aspects of
the action required at this critical moment. Two notions are central in this
context:	urgent action for the protection of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its
people and political coherence in the action pursued by the United Nations.
The PRESIDENT:	I thank the representative of Slovenia for his kind
words addressed to my predecessor and to me.
The next speaker is the representative of Germany. I invite him to take
a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr, GRAF ZU RANTZAU (Germany) (interpretation from French): Today
is my first opportunity, Sir, to speak before the Council under your
presidency. Please allow me, therefore, to offer you my congratulations. I
have no doubt that the work of the Council will benefit this month from your
high competence and that it will register important advances at a time when
the international community, through the United Nations, has been prompted to
assume greater responsibilities. I also take this opportunity to express my
S/PV.3201
53
(Mr, Graf zu Rantzau, Germany)
deep gratitude to Ambassador O'Brien for the manner in which he guided the
Council's work in recent weeks.
Apart from the adoption of Security Council resolution 820 (1993),
unreservedly endorsed by Germany, the current debate on Bosnia and Herzegovina
is not irrelevant. It is one more sign that the patience of the international
community is running out. As to Srebrenica, everything has already been said
in resolution 819 (1993). I should like only to draw attention to two
aspects. The population of the district of Srebrenica was 75 per cent Muslim
before the conflict erupted. The Vance-Owen plan did not attach that district
to a province with a Serb majority. This speaks volumes about the Serbs'
approach. Just as we must strive to spare the civilian population further
suffering, we must also be aware of the fact that that city has almost
fallen. Any evacuation of the civilian population, however orderly or
"peaceful, must be viewed as ""ethnic cleansing"" by force originated by the"
Serbs and therefore as a crime. Any support lent to a possible evacuation can
only be justified as interference aimed at saving the civilian population from
massacre and oppression. At the same time, those responsible for this
barbarity - whose names are well known to us - should be reminded that they
will have to answer personally for their acts.
For that matter, developments around Srebrenica represent only a part of
an overall and particularly alarming development. The Serbian party has
rejected the peace plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina. It will also most likely
repudiate the April 6 cease-fire in Croatia once again. The oppression of the
Albanian majority in Kosovo is deepening. The minorities of Sandjak and
Vojvodina are subject to unrelenting pressure. Less than ever before can one
speak of their rights being respected.
S/PV.3201
54-55
(Mr. Graf zu Rantzau, Germany)
In sum, all of this implies that the Serbs' policy of force against the
smallest and weakest of the nations of the former Yugoslavia is being
pursued. It signals in particular a continued drive to exterminate the
Muslims, who represent the largest national community in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. The intellectual, material and political centre of this war of
nationalist conquest is in Belgrade. Its strategic direction is controlled
from that city. The weapons terrorizing the population to exhaustion come
from that centre. It is thence that assistance in materiel and personnel is
sent. The paramilitary units of Serbia and Montenegro, at least, are
financed, equipped and transported from Belgrade. And it is thence that
propaganda is broadcast, the unbridled nationalism of which is responsible for
the vitiation of all moral scruples vis-a-vis the non-Serbian civilian
population.
S/PV.3201
56
(Mr, Graf zu Rantzau,
Germany)
If we look at what has been happening over the last 18 months we must
find that a sincere readiness to accept a political solution based on patterns
for a solution worked out by the international bodies responsible for settling
the conflict and adopted by the international community as a whole has never
existed on the Serb side. At no time has the Serbian party been prepared to
honour obligations entered into at the London Conference.
This amounts to an enormous challenge to the international community and
its institutions. The latter have constantly been taken advantage of and
their representatives on the scene have been humiliated time and time again.
To continue to tolerate this situation would bring in its wake the threat of
irrevocably losing credibility and would entail consequences that would go
beyond the confines of the current conflict.
This loss of credibility is all the more imminent inasmuch as the
international community cannot shirk its share of responsibility in the
current situation. The Serb leadership has been able unscrupulously to take
advantage of the fact that the arms embargo has contributed to weakening the
weakest still further. They have pursued a stalling strategy and, as we have
noted today, they have negotiated in appearance only so as to pursue in the
meantime their policy of conquest and also make the most of the patience shown
by the international community.
We must now draw the inevitable conclusions in the light of all these
facts. The game being pursued by the Serbs can no longer be tolerated. We
must put an end to the destruction of a State Member of the United Nations.
Guaranteeing the physical and political survival of the Muslim community in
its own State of Bosnia Herzegovina must now become an absolute priority.
S/PV.3201
57
(Mr, Graf zu Rantzau,
Germany)
If one party had truly been ready to envisage a political solution on the
basis of a military victory of the Serbs, today's debate should eliminate all
doubt that the policy of force being pursued by the Serbs will never enjoy
international recognition. The Serb leadership should be clearly informed
about the price Serbia will have to pay for a military triumph which in the
long run could in any case be no more than ephemeral. It is now up to Serbia
to opt for a timely return to the way of the community of civilized States.
"The PRESIDENT; I thank the representative of Germany for the kind"
words he addressed to my predecessor and to me.
The next speaker is the representative of Italy. I invite him to take a
place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr, SCIALOJA (Italy): Allow me to extend to you, Sir, our
congratulations on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council
for the month of April. We are fully confident that your well-known
diplomatic qualities and experience will allow you to successfully guide the
Council at this difficult time.
Allow me also to pay a tribute to Ambassador O'Brien of New Zealand for
his exemplary presidency of the Security Council last month.
The Italian Government believes that the new sanctions against Serbia and
Montenegro, adopted by the Security Council in its resolution 820 (1993),
represent a firm, appropriate and, regretfully, necessary answer of the
international community to the refusal of the Bosnian Serbs to accept the
Vance-Owen peace plan, to the continuation of their military offensive against
the Muslim population of Srebrenica and to their massive violations of human
rights. This unavoidable measure, about whose adoption both Bosnian Serbs and
the Government of Belgrade had been duly warned, aims at two objectives: to
S/PV.3201
58
(Mr, Scialoia, Italy)
discourage further military aggression and to persuade the Bosnian Serb
authorities to agree to the peace plan and contribute to its implementation in
order to preserve the independence and territorial integrity of Bosnia and
Herzegovina and stability in the Balkans.
As the current Chairman of the Western European Union, Italy will honour
its commitment to ensure an effective and coordinated enforcement of the
strengthened sanctions in the Adriatic Sea.
We welcome the recent agreement, following the adoption of resolution
819 (1993), on a cease-fire in Srebrenica, the deployment of the United
Nations Protection Force in that city and its demilitarization, the delivery
of humanitarian supplies and the evacuation of the wounded. In this
connection, I wish to recall that the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, in
a message to President Cosic, urged him to end the fighting in Eastern Bosnia
and, in particular, in Srebrenica.
The decision of the United Nations to strengthen the sanctions should be
a clear indication to the Bosnian Serbs that the international community no
longer intends to tolerate their defiance of international law and principles,
apparently accompanied by a misleading presumption of impunity. The Bosnian
Serb leaders must above all understand that they will not be permitted to
occupy new territories in the days preceding the enforcement of resolution 820
(1993). If, indeed, all armed attacks do not cease immediately, the
international community will be forced to consider further measures to oppose
them, not excluding, as a last resort, selective initiatives of a military
nature, which should obviously avoid all unnecessary suffering by the civilian
population. As a matter of fact, the course of action adopted by the Security
Council is not directed against the Bosnian Serb population, nor the
S/PV.3201
59-60
(Mr, Scialoia, Italy)
population of Serbia and Montenegro, but against all those responsible for
violations of human rights and incitement of intolerance.
Finally, we would like to stress that, should the Bosnian Serb leaders
choose to end their military aggression, agree to the terms of the Vance-Owen
plan, and contribute to its complete implementation, the Italian Government
would favour - as stated to the Belgrade authorities during bilateral
consultations - a gradual softening of the sanctions, the progressive
reinstatement of Serbia and Montenegro in the international community and the
adoption of a plan for economic reconstruction of the whole region.
"The PRESIDENT; I thank the representative of Italy for the kind"
words addressed to my predecessor and to me.
The next speaker is the representative of Romania. I invite him to take
a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr, VOICU (Romania): I should like first of all to extend to you,
Sir, and to Pakistan our congratulations on your assumption of the high office
of President of the Security Council for the month of April. Your tremendous
diplomatic ability, vast experience and fine leadership are the best
assurances that the Council will successfully perform its mandate this month.
We wish also to express our appreciation to Ambassador O'Brien of New Zealand
for the excellent way in which he guided the work of the Council during March.
The major concern of Romania about the situation in the former Yugoslavia
has been made manifest in many instances and circumstances, including in the
Security Council on 25 September 1991.
S/PV.3201
61
(Mr, Voicu, Romania)
Romania is a country with a unique position in our area, because it never
waged war against any of the peoples of the former Yugoslavia. Our
perceptions and attitude are burnished by history and are in no way biased by
territorial or other interests of any kind. As a State providing constant and
full evidence of balanced conduct and good relations with all the former
Yugoslav republics, Romania is determined further to support the intensive
efforts of the international community to solve the tragic Yugoslav crisis,
and to halt the military confrontation throughout the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
The Government of Romania supports the peace plan for Bosnia and
Herzegovina set out in the report of the Secretary-General on the peace talks
held by the Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International
Conference on the Former Yugoslavia. In the same context, Romania backs the
activity of the Security Council on this important subject, as well as the
measures undertaken by the European Community in cooperation with the
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) and the recent
decisions of the Western European Union. Romania welcomes the political
initiatives of the United States in this respect and shares its hope that the
gravity of the situation in the area will develop a consensus among the
members of the Security Council. That hope is particularly topical today,
after the adoption of Security Council resolution 820 (1993) of 17 April 1993.
Romania is deeply alarmed and concerned about the magnitude of the plight
of innocent victims of the conflict in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina
and is therefore in favour of attracting the cooperation of all realistic and
S/PV.3201
62
(Mr, Voicu, Romania!
responsible factors from the area, whose contribution is essential for
creating conditions which could ensure political dialogue and the
identification of viable compromise solutions in the interest of all parties.
At the same time efforts should, in our view, be channeled towards the
prevention of the expansion of hotbeds of tension under circumstances in which
some analysts warn of a global epidemic of conflict. Those efforts should
guarantee a lasting halt to the fighting and must galvanize and focus the
trend against the emergence of new elements of tension which could lead to the
escalation of a crisis of extreme complexity.
For Romania the absolute priority is the political settlement of the
Yugoslav crisis. As the first non-European-Community neighbouring country
represented on the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the
Former Yugoslavia last year and also at present, Romania has consistently
stressed that a political settlement is the only alternative acceptable to all
parties to the conflict. Therefore we fully support the demand expressed by
the Security Council that all the parties and others concerned continue to
observe the cease-fire and refrain from any further hostilities. By making
that demand, the Council has demonstrated its commitment to a peaceful
settlement and its resolve to end this conflict, which has been filled with
tragedy from the start.
Convinced that the international community has a duty to encourage the
parties to reach a political settlement, Romania is determined to continue its
non-involvement in the conflict and to strengthen its role as a factor for
stability in the area, We believe that all neighbouring countries should act
in the same spirit and manner. We in Romania are very sensitive to the
S/PV.3201
63
(Mr, Voicu, Romania)
dangerous developments in the former Yugoslavia and we are of the opinion that
the neighbouring countries have the great responsibility to act in such a way
as to prevent exacerbation of the conflict and to further a political
solution. We are also of the view that a solution will be viable only to the
extent that it takes into full account the tragic realities in the former
Yugoslavia. Indeed, Yugoslavia's neighbours, the other European countries and
the United Nations have to do everything in their power to help the parties
involved come to a valid and lasting agreement.
Recent experience has illustrated the fact that the attitude of Romania -
of equal rapprochement towards all State entities of the former Yugoslavia -
facilitates the establishment of contacts with all political representatives
who can make a meaningful contribution to the process of consensus building
and who can illuminate the human responsibility of politicians to stop the
tragic events in the area.
At the international level, Romania supports the relevant activities and
decisions of the United Nations concerning the Yugoslav crisis. We consider
that the resolutions of the Security Council should be implemented in good
faith by all the parties involved and others concerned, as well as by all
States Members of the United Nations in accordance with the Charter of the
world Organization. The Romanian Government, for its part, gives full backing
to the Vance-Owen plan, which appears at present to be the only way out of the
crisis and whose clear and unambiguous acceptance in full by all parties could
mark a crucial turning-point in the overall efforts leading to a peaceful
political settlement.
S/PV.3201
64
(Mr. Voicu, Romania)
It is relevant to recall that 64 years ago the great Romanian diplomat
Nicolae Titulescu said:
(snoke in French)
"""It is my deep conviction based on observations that war is never -"
never - the solution of a conflict. At the best of times - that is to
say when you are victorious - war can only change the terms of the
problem: tomorrow’s discontent replaces today's. A war in the name of
justice is followed by another war in the name of justice, ad infinitum.
And at what price? It is an enormous price paid by the entire
international community for the subjective reasons of one or several of
"its members""."
( spoke in..English)
In a recent statement by the Government of Romania it is emphasized that
while understanding the point of view of the leadership of the Bosnian Serb
party, for which the acceptance of the Vance-Owen plan would mean new
sacrifices, such sacrifices would be incomparably smaller than the heavy loss
in human lives caused by the continuation of the conflict. By the same token
the. Romanian Government has launched an appeal addressed to the neighbours of
former Yugoslavia, to States of the area and to other countries concerned to
exercise all their influence on the parties in conflict to make a positive
contribution to halting the acts of violence, to prevent the danger of the
expansion of the conflict and to promote the political settlement of existing
problems.
As to the resolutions of the Security Council, my country observes in
good faith the sanctions adopted against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(Serbia and Montenegro). It should be noted that Romania was the first
S/PV.3201
65
(Mr, Voicu, Romania)
country which asked for international monitoring of the observance of the
embargo, along our Danube border with former Yugoslavia. Very recently,
Romania has expressed its willingness to increase the number of Sanctions
Assistance Mission observers. In the same field, Romania is grateful to the
United States of America for dispatching to us some patrol boats as assistance
for monitoring the embargo on the Danube. Consultations are under way with
the Western European Union on conditions for technical assistance it has
offered Romania and other countries along the Danube.
The position of Romania on the subject under consideration is fully
consistent with the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. Our conduct
will continue to be the same in spite of the ample negative conseguences on
the course of economic reforms in Romania deriving from the observance of
sanctions. The implementation of resolution 820 (1993) is going to engender
further economic hardships for my country. Having invoked Article 50 of the
United Nations Charter, the Romanian Government expresses its hope that it
will have the support of the international community in identifying specific
forms of compensation to solve the economic difficulties entailed in
compliance with the sanctions regime. We are encouraged in this respect by
recent decisions on that issue taken by the Security Council and hope that the
forthcoming consultations under Article 50 of the Charter will be fruitful for
Romania.
We find great merit in the Security Council resolutions dealing with the
humanitarian dimension of the Yugoslav crisis. We are deeply concerned at the
great number of innocent victims and displaced persons who have been forced to
S/PV.3201
65 (a-z)
(Mr, Voicu, Romania)
abandon their homes and property. In this respect we share the opinion
expressed before the Council by Mr. Cyrus Vance that everything possible must
be done to bring humanitarian relief and assistance to the suffering
communities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We also believe that the serious
violations of international humanitarian law and basic human rights are
intolerable. At present the Romanian Government is considering the
possibility of receiving a limited number of refugees, in particular children,
■from the conflict areas. We are in contact in that regard with the Geneva
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
S/PV.3201
66
(Mr, Voicu, Romania)
We continue to be confident that through new and perseverant efforts
viable solutions can be found to halt a conflict whose continuation is
absurd. As in the past, when Romania was a member of this body, we believe
that the unity of the Security Council on this important matter is a basic
prerequisite for the success of its endeavours. We are also convinced of the
value of the efforts to be undertaken by the Secretary-General and will be
awaiting hopefully his report to the Security Council, as requested in
paragraph 8 of resolution 820 (1993).
On 16 April 1993 Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali stated,
(spoke in French)
"""No doubt in recent years we have found cause for hope, especially"
when the collapse of the Berlin Wall simultaneously shattered the bloc
mentality, of which it was the sad symbol. Some actually saw the end of
this confrontation as the dawn of a world at peace and even, ingenuously,
as the culmination of history.
"""Developments have rapidly made us more realistic again. In a very"
"short time, the outlook has become singularly overcast"".	(SG/SM/4979,"
£a_2)
(spoke in English)
We trust that the clouds will vanish and that the situation in the former
Yugoslavia will return to normalcy, thereby restoring peace and stability to
that troubled area. It is Romania's fervent hope that a’just and lasting
solution can be achieved, in harmony with the aspirations of all peace-loving
nations.
The PRESIDENT: I thank the representative of Romania for his kind
words addressed to my predecessor and to me.
S/PV.3201
67
(The President)
The next name on the list of speakers is that of the representative of
Afghanistan. I invite him to take a place at the Council table and to make
his statement.
Mr. FARHADI (Afghanistan): I have the privilege, Mr. President, to
have known you for more than a decade, and I know the high moral principles
you cherish and your remarkable ability in dealing with very difficult
matters. I congratulate you on your leadership in presiding over the Council.
The Islamic State of Afghanistan, as a matter of policy, supports, in
cases like this, the efforts of the non-aligned group, particularly the
non-aligned caucus, in which you, Mr. President, have played a great part, of
the Organization of the Islamic Conference and of course of the United
Nations. Therefore, Afghanistan fully supports resolution 820 (1993) of
17 April, which elaborates, in a way, and lists the problems and to some
degree provides remedies. But if Afghanistan approves of resolution
820 (1993), it also recognizes it as the minimum that could be done to protect
the credibility of the United Nations, which must not surrender to the forces
of aggression once again.
We find that the many economic sanctions mentioned in the resolution may
not be fully adequate. There are still in the text some remnants of
healf-hearted measures, some remnants of hesitation and some remnants of what
has been called realism in some powerful countries. That realism is doing
nothing but providing permissiveness for the Bosnian Serbs.
We Afghans know that, because for 11 years we experienced many similar
situations. The President of the Council is himself an expert on the history
of the war in Afghanistan, and he knows how much of a resemblance there is
between what is happening today in Bosnia and what happened in Afghanistan:
an attack on sovereignty, on territorial integrity and on the political
S/PV.3201
68-70
(Mr, Farhadi, Afghanistan)
"independence of a nation and taking territory by brute force; that is the"
resemblance. Of course, there is killing of civilians, including women and
children, with ferocious brutality. We Afghans lost 1.7 million people in
that way. Displaced persons are the other problem that makes this case
resemble the Afghan case: the expulsion of people, forced to flee from their
ancestral dwellings.
The magnitude of this human tragedy is akin to the tragedy of
Afghanistan. The war in Bosnia has in some ways surpassed the tragedy of the
"Afghan war - in some ways. The label ""ethnic cleansing"" is not even"
linguistically accurate. In fact, it is simply an extermination on the basis
of religion. Hence it is a return to the most barbaric ways of the Middle
Ages. Of course, all of us know that the International Court of Justice
issued a preliminary ruling stating that there is sufficient basis to say that
violations of the Convention on genocide is being committed against the Muslim
Bosnian people. Therefore, there are serious violations of international
humanitarian law, and the leaders responsible for these crimes are well known.
Of course, since I have mentioned the Middle Ages, let us remember that
today the aggression against civilians - the killing, the policy of
extermination - is performed with the most modern weaponry, in addition to
that very modern tactic of hypocritical propaganda of the hegemonist Bosnian
Serb leaders.
To return to the war in Afghanistan, another difference is that in the
case of the Bosnian war, the systematic detention and rape of women practised
in massive proportions by the Bosnian Serbs is atrocious, while some of their
leaders are even considering that this crime is a means of imposing the morals
of the invaders. This is an insult to the honour of us all.

(Mr, Farhadi, Afghanistan)
Now, of course, there is the peace plan, which, of course, does not
"adequately recompense the victims among the Muslims of Bosnia; rather, it in"
many cases rewards the territorial aggressions of the Bosnian Serbs. And this
plan has been prepared taking into consideration some of the expansionist
views of the Bosnian Serb leaders, yet the Bosnian Croats and Muslims have,
however, accepted it, as the representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina said
today, as a necessary vehicle. However, the Bosnian Serb refusal to accept
the plan proves that it was wrong to be optimistic in talking to the Bosnian
Serbs about it, that it was useless to take into account the Bosnian Serbs'
claims in the process of preparing the peace plan.
And what has happened in the last few days in Srebrenica? The Bosnian
Serbs, having first pledged that they would not shoot, then did shoot, carried
out massive shelling and killed civilians, later shamelessly claiming that
they had done nothing - the denials are coming in. These are the facts.
Therefore, in order to save the honour of everybody here, I think that there
is a need to use air power against the Serbian military lines for any country,
community, pact or organization that has the ability to do so if it claims to
protect human rights and justice. This is a question of honour: we must
study how urgent steps can be taken to bomb the Bosnian Serb artillery units
before they kill more women and children and wound many others.
In what was said here today before I spoke many important points were
raised. I am sure that you, Mr. President, and the Council, will study all
the important proposals that were made today over and above what is contained
in resolution 820 (1993). Of course, many of the points received support from
many delegations, and these concerned meaningful action and effective
measures, including military action, that should be taken, first of all, in
S/PV.3201
72
(Mr, Farhadi, Afghanistan)
"order to take control of, or to neutralize the Bosnian Serbs' heavy weapons;"
secondly, to interdict the supply lines from Serbia-Montenegro - I call it
"that because the name ""Yugoslavia"" is illegal - that penetrate Bosnia;"
thirdly, to state clearly that the arms embargo does not deprive the side that
has been aggressed - the Bosnian Muslims - of their inalienable right to self-
defence. It must be made possible for Bosnian Muslims to untie their hands,
to receive arms in order to defend their lives and the honour of humanity.
Fourthly, a war crimes tribunal must be established pursuant to United Nations
documents already before us. Fifthly, a committee must be set up in due
course to assess the destruction of all kinds committed against the Bosnian
Muslims, in order to ascertain the war reparations to be paid by the
aggressors and by Belgrade.	■
I found that in the proposals by the representative of Slovenia there
"were some very interesting points; the Slovenians know the subject and they"
are on the spot, as a neighbouring country. However, they were, again,
minimalistic.
As far as the special session of the General Assembly is concerned, many
"countries, I know, support it; but specific endeavours must precede it -"
endeavours by various natio.is and by the United Nations - because the special
session of the General Assembly must not become a forum for delaying tactics,
and we know how expert the Bosnian Serb leaders are at delaying tactics. A
special session of the General Assembly must also be a means for undertaking
serious endeavours on the pnrt of all nations against what has become a
dishonour for humanity.

The PRESIDENT: I thank the representative of Afghanistan for his
kind words addressed to me.
The next speaker is the representative of Croatia. I invite him to take
a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr, DROBNJAK (Croatia): On behalf of my delegation I have the
honour to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the
Security Council during this month of April. Your distinguished diplomatic
skills have enabled you to guide this body around several difficult obstacles
in its deliberations in recent days. I should also like to express our
profound appreciation for the tireless efforts of your predecessor, Ambassador
Terence O'Brien of New Zealand, for his capable statesmanship and for the wise
manner in which he guided the work of the Security Council during the month of
March.
"""The entire international community has been affronted by a series"
of brutal acts. ... Fellow members of the Security Council ... we meet
at the hinge of history. We can use the end of the cold war to get
beyond the whole pattern of settling conflicts by force, or we can slip
back into ever more savage regional conflicts in which might alone makes
"right. ... Simply put, it is a choice between right and wrong."""
(S/PV.2963, pd, 101-105)
Those brave words, which perfectly match the tragic situation in the
Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and are, indeed, the appropriate answer to
the barbaric Serbian aggression, have already been spoken before the members
of the Security Council, by James Baker III on 29 November 1990. In deciding
to confront the Iraqi aggression against Kuwait, the world made a choice
between right and wrong and did not stand idly by. But now it is unwilling to
take decisive action.
S/PV.3201
76
(Mr. Drobniak, Croatia)
It goes without saying that the United Nations made enormous efforts to
stop the bloodshed in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to ease the suffering of the
anguished population. But phrases and medicine are not enough. Unfortunately,
in the last two years - during the Servian aggression against Croatia and
Bosnia and Herzegovina - strong words have not been followed by strong acts.
While the Security Council has been passing resolutions - 37 of them so far =
"ruthless Serbian forces have been ""passing"" ""ethnic cleansing"", thus carving"
"in blood the borders of ""Greater Serbia""."
The horror in Srebrenica comes as no surprise to one who has seen the
destruction of Vukovar and the slaughter of captured wounded Croatian soldiers
and civilians. The mass graves around Vukovar are horrifying harbingers of
what will happen after Srebrenica and other towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina
are overrun by Serbian forces. But it is not only Bosnia and Herzegovina that
is at stake: European security and stability as a whole will be dangerously
undermined if Serbian fascism is not stopped immediately and all its war
criminals are not brought to justice. In Srebrenica the community of nations
must defend the new post-cold-war world order and the basic principles of the
United Nations Charter, not only for the sake of those who are suffering, but
also for the sake of the generations to come.
At this moment Serbians are pounding civilian targets in Sarajevo and all
across Bosnia and Herzegovina. They are also shelling Croatian cities along
the Adriatic coast and mainland. Just a few hours ago, the very centre of the
ancient Croatian coastal town of Sibenik was heavily pounded by salvoes from
multiple rocket launchers. The result of this savage Serbian attack is 2 dead
and 11 wounded civiliians - two of the wounded have life-threatening injuries.
S/PV.3201
77
(Mr. Drobniak, Croatia)
For many months, Serbian aggression, transparently wrapped in the
unfounded statements about the endangered Serbian population that needs
protection at any cost, remained unchallenged by the world community. The
results of all those futile compromises and inadequate responses can be seen
in the graveyards and ruins that stretch from Vukovar, Zadar, Dubrovnik and
Osijek to Sarajevo, Gorazde and Srebrenica. The only Serbian reponse to the
Security Council demands so far has been the endless tide of humiliated
refugees, death camps, raped women and massacred prisoners and disregard for
elementary norms of international humanitarian law.
How many times has it been clearly and loudly stated that the only
language the Serbian aggressor understands is the language of force? The
United Nations General Assembly on 18 December 1992 adopted a resolution in
which it expressed determination to restore peace in the Republic of Bosnia
and Herzegovina as well as to preserve its unity, sovereignty, political
independence and territorial integrity. So far, none of these goals has been
achieved. In operative paragraph 7 of this resolution, the General Assembly
urged the Security Council to consider measures on an urgent basis, but no
later than 15 January 1993, using all necessary means to stop the Serbian
aggression, including the lifting of the arms embargo. The 15th of January
passed long ago, and the only results thus far have been more destruction and
"more territory ""ethnically cleansed"" by the murderous Serbian forces."
The Republic of Croatia has had painful experience of Serbian aggression
and is still under continuous attacks by Serbian paramilitary units that have
occupied parts of Croatian territory. The expansionist attempts to create
Serbian states inside the Republics of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina and
to annex them to Serbia are contrary to all the fundamental principles that
S/PV.3201
78
(Mr. Drobniak, Croatia)
world peace and stability are based on. The fact that Serbian extremists are
openly refusing to honour the major Security Council resolutions that
emphasize the commitment to ensure respect for the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina must lead to appropriate United Nations action. The United
Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) operation should be aimed not only at the
cessation of hostilites but also at the determined protection of the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the two United Nations Member States
that are exposed to foreign aggression.
What is the way out of the humanitarian, moral and political disaster in
Bosnia and Herzegovina? The answers are simple and easy to find: First, we
must stop the Serbian aggression, using all necessary means. Secondly, we
must start to implement all the relevant Security Council resolutions.
Thirdly, all sides must accept and carry out the peace plan proposed by the
co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the
Former Yugoslavia. Croatia strongly supports the proposed peace plan for
Bosnia and Herzegovina, which must be implemented in a way that will protect
the legitimate interest of all three constituent nations of that Republic.
Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina were the first to sign all the elements of
the Vance-Owen plan and are ready to cooperate with the United Nations in its
fulfilment.
We sincerely regret the recent tragic clashes between Croat and Muslim
forces in central Bosnia, which were a result of the extreme tension in the
entire area and the failure to fufil the Vance-Owen plan. These sad events
S/PV.3201
79
(Mr. Drobniak, Croatia)
are one more example of how important it is to speed up the peace process and
immediately start implementing the Vance-Owen plan. The Croatian Government
will do everything possible within its capacity to help solve the grave
situation in central Bosnia and to stop the fighting between allied Croatian
and Muslim forces. This fighting can only benefit the Serbian aggressor.
Croatia firmly supports the joint agreement on the immediate cessation of the
hostilities, signed yesterday between the President of the Republic of Bosnia
and Herzegovina, Alija Izetbegovic, and the President of the Croatian
Community of Herzeg-Bosna, Mate Boban.
It is obvious that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is very much
linked to what is happening in the occupied parts of the Republic of Croatia.
Both Republics are exposed to Serbian aggression, which is being orchestrated
by the top political and army circles in Belgrade. This is the fact that the
Security Council should take into account when determining future action by
the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). The first, and essential,
steps must be the complete disarming of Serbian paramilitary units, the
creation of the conditions for the safe and voluntary return of all the
refugees, and the securing of the international borders of Croatia and Bosnia
and Herzegovina, in accordance with the relevant Security Council
resolutions. We are advocating the creation of safe-haven areas in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, which must be under total United Nations protection. But just
easing the horrendous human suffering is not enough: strengthening the
UNPROFOR mandate and changing the nature of the United Nations forces from a
peace-keeping to a peace-making force which is capable of fulfilling all the
goals emphasized in Security Council resolutions is the essential step towards
peace and stability in the Balkans.
S/PV.3201
80
(Mr, Drobniak, Croatia)
Croatia welcomes Security Council resolution 820 (1993), which imposes
news sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and
Montenegro) and is aimed at exhausting the Serbian military machine and
blunting the virulent nationalism of Serbian warlords. We particularly
welcome operative paragraph 12 of this resolution, which gives the Croatian
Government authority over the import, export and transhipment through the
United Nations protected areas, thus emphasizing the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia within its internationally
recognized borders. The Security Council in its resolution 815 (1993) firmly
stated that these protected areas are an integral part of the territory of the
Republic of Croatia, and we hail that paragraph as a concrete step in the
operative confirmation of that fact.
The Security Council, acting under Chapter VII of the Charter, should
immediately take the strongest possible measures against the Serbian
aggressors. If the world is not yet ready for this, then the United Nations
must at least lift the arms embargo which has been imposed upon the Republic
of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the world must
provide Croats and Muslims the opportunity successfully to defend their
freedom and human dignity. The legitimate right to self-defence inscribed in
the United Nations Charter must not be limited for the sake of dubious
political pragmatism.

The PRESIDENT: I thank the representative of Croatia for his kind
words addressed to my predecessor and me.
The next speaker is Mr. Engin Ansay, Permanent Observer of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference to the United Nations, to whom the
Council has extended an invitation under rule 39 of its provisional rules of
procedure. I invite him to take a place at the Council table and to make his
statement.
Mr, ANSAY: At the outset on this solemn occasion, I should like
with deep sorrow to avail myself of the opportunity to offer my Oganization's
expression of condolence to the Government and people of Turkey on the sudden
and untimely demise of His Excellency Mr. Tirgut Ozal, the eighth President of
the Republic of Turkey and a great statesman of sagacious foresight, immense
tolerance and the qualities of constructive leadership.
May I extend to you, Sir, my warmest congratulations on your assumption
of the presidency of the Security Council during this most difficult period.
We are indeed confident that your vast experience and very well known
professional skills will serve well in the successful discharge of the complex
task currently facing the Security Council. If this question is before the
Council today, after nearly a year's delay, it is thanks to your personal
efforts and to those of the Non-Aligned Caucus and the membership and the
Contact Group of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC).
I should like to take this opportunity to thank your predecessor, the
Permanent Representative of New Zealand, Ambassador Terence Christopher
O'Brien, for his able performance in steering the work of the Council during
the month of March.
S/PV.3201
82
(Mr, Ansay.)
Last but not least, I should like to pay a tribute through you, Sir, to
Mr. Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of
the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia for their untiring
efforts in the search for peace in the former Yugoslavia, to all the valiant
members of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in the area, and to
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mrs. Ogata, for her
courageous humanitarian efforts, as well as to the other international
humanitarian organizations engaged and involved in bringing relief and aid to
thousands suffering in Bosnia and other parts of the former Yugoslavia.
The Organization of the Islamic Conference is deeply concerned,
frustrated and angered over the latest developments with regard to the
situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and has made numerous efforts to restore
peace and promote reconciliation since the very inception of this crisis. The
Secretary-General of the OIC, Mr. Hamid Algabid, personally visited Sarajevo
and Zagreb quite recently and established contact and held meetings with the
parties concerned.
In my intervention before the General Assembly last December, I gave a
detailed account of all the efforts undertaken by the OIC, an active member of
the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the Former
Yugoslavia, concerning this tragic situation, which has been a source of
immense worry and sorrow to the Organization of the Islamic Conference rom
the very beginning. This time, I shall try to be brief and to focus on the
bare essentials which are urgently required to remedy, if that is even
possible at this point, the plight of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
S/PV.3201
83
(Mr. Ansav)
The Secretary-General of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
regards Security Council resolutions 819 (1993) and 820 (1993) on Srebrenica
and the economic sanctions adopted over the weekend as inadequate and
insufficient. Had they been adopted much earlier, they might have served a
good cause. The Secretary-General of the OIC has expressed the anguish,
indignation and shock of the Islamic world over the feeble response of the
Security Council to the continued siege and criminal bombing by the Serbian
"forces of Srebrenica, which is about to fall or be ""ethnically cleansed""."
The Secretary-General of the OIC strongly deplored the fact that efforts
made by the Islamic Group at the United Nations in New York to put an end to
the Serbian aggression have been rendered futile so far by the prevarication
and shirking of responsibility by some States, permanent members of the
Security Council, whose attitude has prevented the Council from taking
adequate appropriate measures in time to stop the war in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. For the OIC, the fall of Srebrenica, designated as a Muslim
province under the Vance-Owen plan, will sound the death knell of the ongoing
peace efforts in respect of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the auspices of the
United Nations and the European Community.
We firmly believe that these tragic events constitute an affront to the
authority of the United Nations and compel a reassessment of the relevance and
efficacy of the principle of collective security on which the founding fathers'
of the United Nations pinned their hopes for constructing a world free from
the scourge of aggression. We also noted that certain permanent members have,
one after the other, invoked the complexities on the ground, the dangers of
the conflict's spilling over, and of bloodshed on a larger scale, to prevent
S/PV.3201
84
(Mr, Ansay)
the Security Council from taking vigorous action to bring the Serbian
aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina to an end.
"Today, while genocide and ""ethnic cleansing"" continue unabated, while"
mosgues and Catholic churches are razed and civilians are forced to flee under
the threat of death, while concentration camps continue to operate, with new
detainees delivered all the time, while scores of Bosnian cities are being
subjected to ferocious bombing by the Serb forces, while thousands of Muslims
are being massacred and women are being raped, these same countries cite the
holding of the referendum in another country as a sufficient reason to prevent
the Security Council from taking measures required by such a situation for
safeguarding international peace and security. The Islamic world cannot and
will no longer accept such a scandalous conception of international legality
and of the role of the Security Council.
We had hoped that those who had opposed effective action by the Security
Council in the face of the criminal aggression of which Bosnia and Herzegovina
is a victim, and counted on latent Serbian pacifism, would realize today the
error and futility of their approach. The question before the Council today
is no longer one of acting with a view to isolating Serbia or decreeing new
economic sanctions against it, as resolution 820 (1993) does. The tragic
. course of events calls for vigorous and determined action on the part of the
Security Council if the objective is really to prevent the annihilation of
hundreds of thousands of Muslims and to stop the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The OIC, in accordance with the will of the overwhelming majority of the
international community as reflected in General Assembly resolution 47/121,
calls for the immediate lifting of the iniquitous arms embargo imposed against
Bosnia and Herzegovina and the adoption of effective military measures under
S/PV.3201
85
(Mr, Ansay)
the aegis of the Security Council to bring the Serbian aggression to an end.
These include, inter alia, that the United Nations should interdict the supply
lines bringing weapons and troops from Serbia and Montenegro and proceed to
mandate that all heavy weapons be placed under the control of the
international community. This is required by the military arrangements of the
Vance-Owen plan, which was one of the documents agreed by all the parties.
The non-aligned members of the Security Council have already strongly endorsed
this plan and have drafted a Security Council resolution that authorizes
further appropriate measures to take control or otherwise neutralize the heavy
weapons.
In conclusion, the Organization of the Islamic Conference once again
submits to the Council this tragic humanitarian case, which will probably have
unprecedented repercussions if not tackled in a swift, adequate and effective
manner. We expect and plead for concrete action, without further delay, in
the form of precise measures to which I and several other speakers have
referred in our interventions.
The PRESIDENT: I thank the Observer of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference for his kind words addressed to my predecessor and to me.
There are no further speakers for this meeting. The next meeting of the
Security Council to continue consideration of the item on the agenda will take
place tomorrow, Tuesday, 20 April 1993, at 11.30 a.m.
The meeting rose at 6.10 p.m.
