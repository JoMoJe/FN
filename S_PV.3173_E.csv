ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
The agenda was adopted.	.
THE SITUATION IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): I should like to inform
the Council that I have received aletter from/the representative of Bosnia
and Herzegovina in which he requests to be invited to participate in the
discussion of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual
practice, I propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that
representative to participate in the discussion without the right to vote, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr, Raguz (Bosnia and Herzegovina)
took a place at the Council table.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): The Security Council
will now begin its consideration of the item on its agenda.
The Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding reached in
its prior consultations.
Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have
been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:
"""The Security Council recalls all relevant resolutions of the"
Council and its statement of 25 January (S/25162) concerning the
provision of humanitarian relief in the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. It notes with deep concern that, notwithstanding the
Council's demand in that statement, relief efforts continue to be
impeded. It condemns the blocking of humanitarian convoys and the
S/PV.3173

(The President)
impeding of relief supplies, which place at risk the civilian population
of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and endanger the lives of
personnel delivering such supplies. It remains deeply concerned at the
reports of pressing humanitarian need in the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, particularly in the eastern part of the country.
"""The Council reiterates its demand that the parties and all others"
concerned allow immediate and unimpeded access to humanitarian relief
supplies. It further demands that the parties and others concerned give
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees the guarantees she has
sought that they will abide by the promises they have made to comply with
the Council's decisions in this regard, and thus facilitate the
resumption of the full humanitarian relief programme, to which the
"Council attaches the greatest importance."""
The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item op its agenda.
