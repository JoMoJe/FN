Mr, de ARAUJO CASTRO (Brazil): Mr. President, allow me to begin by
congratulating you on the able and effective manner in which you have been
conducting the work of the Security Council. Allow me, also, to express our
recognition to Ambassador Yoshio Hatano of Japan for his accomplishments as
President of the Council for the month of January.
I have been instructed to make the following statement in connection with
the draft resolution we are about to adopt.
The serious violations of international humanitarian law which have been
taking place in the territory of the former Yugoslavia have outraged the
conscience of humanity. It is with deep sorrow and concern that the Brazilian
Government, and Brazilian society at large, have received the repeated news of
unspeakable atrocities committed within the context of this senseless conflict
on European soil, which must be brought to an end.
The information gathered by the Commission of Experts established
pursuant to Security Council resolution 780 (1992) and by the Special
Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights have provided substantial
evidence of grave breaches of humanitarian law being committed on a massive
scale and in a systematic fashion. These include reports of mass killings,
torture, rape and the unacceptable practices that are referred to by the
"equally unacceptable expression ""ethnic cleansing""."
The international community cannot allow this to continue or to go
unpunished. These grave breaches of the most elementary norms of humanity
must be treated as what in fact they are: criminal acts, crimes against women
and children and other defenceless victims, but also, in the most proper sense
of the expression, crimes against humanity. A cry for justice breaks from
every heart, and that cry cannot go unheeded.
S/PV.3175

(Mr, de Araujo Castro# Brazil)
Brazil favours strong action to ensure the full ascertainment of the
truth about each of the cases of war crimes and crimes against humanity
committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Convinced that effective
prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators of these crimes is a matter of
high moral duty, Brazil supports the establishment of an international
criminal tribunal to bring to justice the individuals found to be responsible
for such abominable acts. It is in that spirit that we will vote in favour of
the draft resolution before the Security Council.
We will support, and we stand ready to contribute to, the work to be
carried out by the Secretary-General in elaborating specific proposals and
options for the implementation of the decision to be taken today.

(Mr, de Araujo Castro, Brazil)
It is of particular importance that the international tribunal to be
established rest on a solid legal foundation, which will ensure the
effectiveness of its actions. To that end, we believe that in dealing with
many of the issues at hand, it should prove useful to draw on the studies and
discussions that over the years have been undertaken within the United Nations
on the exceedingly complex legal question of an international criminal
jurisdiction.
As regards the definition of the best method for the establishment of an
ad hoc international criminal tribunal, it should be borne in mind that the
authority of the Security Council is not self-constituted but originates from
a delegation of powers by the whole membership of the Organization. It is
never too much to recall that the Security Council, in the exercise of its
responsibilities, acts on behalf of the States Members of the United Nations,
in accordance with Article 24, paragraph 1, of the Charter.
Just as the authority of the Council does not spring from the Council
itself but derives from the fact that certain responsibilities have been
conferred upon it by all the Members of the United Nations, the powers of the
Council cannot be created, recreated or reinterpreted creatively by decisions
of the Council itself, but must be based invariably on specific Charter
provisions.	.
It is precisely because the Council exercises a delegated responsibility
in a field as politically sensitive as the maintenance of international peace
and security that the task of interpreting its competences calls for extreme
caution, in particular when invoking language of Chapter VII of the Charter.
Especially when the Council is being increasingly called upon to fully
exercise the considerable powers entrusted to it, the definition of such
S/PV.3175
7
(Mr, de Araujo Castro, Brazil)
powers must be construed strictly on the basis of the text of the relevant
Charter provisions. To go beyond that would be legally inconsistent and
politically unwise.	•
The Security Council can and should play a strong and positive role in
promoting the implementation of the various elements that would contribute to
the peace efforts developed by the Conference on the Former Yugoslavia. That
role, however, can and should remain within the scope of the powers expressly
granted to the Security Council in accordance with the United Nations Charter.
In this rapidly changing world, we consider it increasingly important to
promote the rule of law in international relations by acting to ensure strict
respect for the provisions of our Charter and other norms of international law.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): I thank the
representative of Brazil for the kind words he addressed to me.
Mr, CHEN Ji an (China) (interpretation from Chinese): The Chinese
delegation supports the thrust of the draft resolution before us and will
therefore vote in favour.
Based on our understanding of the nature of the draft resolution before
us, I should like to reiterate for the record that its expected adoption and
my delegation's participation in it do not prejudge China's position on future
Security Council actions on the subject.
.	The PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): I shall now put to the
vote the draft resolution contained in document S/25314.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:	Brazil, Cape Verde, China, Djibouti, France, Hungary, Japan,
Morocco, New Zealand, Pakistan, Russian Federation,
Spain, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America, Venezuela
S/PV.3175

The PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): There were 15 votes in
favour. The draft resolution has therefore been adopted unanimously as
resolution 808 (1993).
I shall now call on those members who wish to make statements following
the voting,
Mr, MERIMEE (France) (interpretation from French): When the first
news and accounts of the atrocities committed on the territory of the former
Yugoslavia began to come in, the collective memory of our peoples had to
relive the horror of times we had thought long past.
But there are lessons to be learned from history. Conditions have
changed since the Second World War. The United Nations now has the
responsibility of maintaining and restoring international peace and security.
Indeed, through the Security Council, the United Nations has firmly committed
itself to this cause in the former Yugoslavia since the adoption on
25 September 1991 of resolution 713 (1991).
The atrocities committed by all sides in the Yugoslav crisis have given
rise to an intolerable situation which is fanning the flames of conflict and
therefore constitutes a threat to international peace and security.
Prosecuting the guilty is necessary if we are to do justice to the
victims and to the international community. Prosecuting the guilty will also
send a clear message to those who continue to commit these crimes‘that they
will be held responsible for their acts. And finally, prosecuting the guilty
is, for the United Nations and particularly for the Security Council, a matter
of doing their duty to maintain and restore peace.
It is with these considerations in mind that the French Minister for
Foreign Affairs asked a group of jurists to draw up a report on setting up an
S/PV.3175
9
(Mr, Merimee, France)
international criminal tribunal that could prosecute persons responsible for
the serious violations of international humanitarian law that have been
committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since the beginning of
that State's process of dissolution. The report, which contains specific
proposals for the establishment of such a tribunal, was concluded in record
time - three weeks. It was made public by the French authorities and
published as a Security Council document. The report concludes in particular
that the creation of an international tribunal for the former Yugoslavia could
be decided on by the Security Council within the framework of its powers under
Chapter VII of the Charter to maintain or restore international peace and
security.
France has endorsed this conclusion and has taken the initiative of
proposing to the Security Council a draft resolution for its implementation.
By adopting unanimously resolution 808 (1993) in pursuance of this
initiative, the Security Council has just taken a decision of major
significance. For the first time in history, the United Nations will be
setting up an international criminal jurisdiction - one that will be competent
to try those who have committed serious violations of international
humanitarian law in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. We already know
from the interim report of the Commission of Experts established pursuant to
Security Council resolution 780 (1992) and through the considerable evidence
that has come in that these atrocities take many forms, from the systematic
"rape of women to the sinister practice of ""ethnic cleansing"" and wholesale"
massacres, and that they are committed in many parts of the territory of the
former Yugoslavia. The Security Council has today taken the solemn decision
that it will not allow these crimes to go unpunished and will not countenance
their continuation.
S/PV.3175
10
(Mr, Merimee, France)
The tribunal that we have just decided to create should be established as
soon as possible. It should be set up through a further decision of the
Security Council under the provisions of Chapter VII, which establishes its
competence in the maintenance and restoration of international peace and
security.
S/PV.3175
11
(Mr, Merimee, France)
In that respect, we expect from the Secretary-General some concrete
proposals of a practical nature that will allow our Council to respond to the
urgency of the situation facing us. The results of all the efforts and
contributions made by France and other countries and in other forums will be
available to him. We have every confidence that Mr. Boutros-Ghali and his
colleagues will succeed in this task, which is of such far-reaching
significance.
We trust that the Security Council will then act with the authority and
unanimity that it has just strikingly displayed in adopting resolution 808
(1993) in order to impose respect for the law.
Ms. ALBRIGHT (United States of America): There is an echo in this
Chamber today. The Nuremberg Principles have been reaffirmed. We have
preserved the long-neglected compact made by the community of civilized
nations 48 years ago in San Francisco to create the United Nations and enforce
the Nuremberg Principles.
The lesson that we are all accountable to international law may have
finally taken hold in our collective memory. This will be no victor's
tribunal. The only victor that will prevail in this endeavour is the truth.
Unlike the world of the 1940s, international humanitarian law today is
impressively codified, well understood, agreed upon and enforceable. The
debates over the state of international law that so encumbered the Nuremberg
Trials will not burden this tribunal.
The United States strongly supports the Council's adoption of today's
historic resolution, which takes the first step in establishing an ad hoc
tribunal to prosecute persons accused of war crimes and other serious
violations of international humanitarian law in the territory of the former
S/PV.3175
12
(Ms, Albright, United States)
Yugoslavia. Virtually all of the parties that have examined this issue,
including the General Assembly, the Co-Chairmen of the International
Conference on the Former Yugoslavia and the Commission of Experts established
by Security Council resolution 780 (1992) have urged the creation of such a
tribunal.
President Bill Clinton has long supported the establishment of a
war-crimes tribunal at the United Nations to bring justice and deter further ,
If
atrocities in the former Yugoslavia. Just 12 days ago, Secretary of State
Warren Christopher, speaking on the President's behalf, explained why the
United States believes that this and other actions are urgently required. As
"the Secretary said;"
"""We cannot ignore the human toll. Serbian ethnic cleansing has been"
"pursued through mass murders; systematic beatings and the rapes of"
"Muslims and others; prolonged shellings of innocents in Sarajevo and"
"elsewhere; forced displacement of entire villages; inhumane treatment of"
"prisoners in the detention camps; and the blockading of relief to the"
sick and starving civilians. Atrocities have been committed by other
parties as well. Our conscience revolts at the idea of passively
"accepting such brutality""."
The Secretary also explained that there is another reason for urgent
action now:
"""There is a broader imperative here. The world's response to the"
violence in the former Yugoslavia is an early and concrete test of how we
will address the concerns of the ethnic and religious minorities in the
"post-cold-war period""."
I quote from the Secretary again:
S/PV.3175
13
(Ms, Albright, United States)
"""The events in the former Yugoslavia raise the questions of whether"
a State may address the rights of its minorities by eradicating those
minorities to achieve ethnic purity. Bold tyrants and fearful minorities
are watching to see whether ethnic cleansing is a policy the world will
tolerate. If we hope to promote the spread of freedom, or if we hope to
encourage the emergence of peaceful, multi-ethnic democracies, our
"answers must be a resounding 'no""'."
The United States has so far submitted five reports to the Council
pursuant to Security Council resolution 771 (1992), which contains
substantiated information about the atrocities that have taken place in the
former Yugoslavia. The Council's action today begins the process of
establishing a war-crimes tribunal. We look forward to working with the
Secretary-General to accomplish expeditiously his task of providing the
Council with options for the statute and rules of procedure of such a tribunal.
Once the Secretary-General's report is received, we, along with the other
members, will act quickly within the Council to establish a tribunal under
Chapter VII. We will also, in cooperation with the United Nations, exert
every effort to ensure that those individuals involved in these outrageous,
heinous crimes are identified and held accountable for their actions, which so
affront the world's collective conscience.
It is worthwhile recalling that the Nuremberg Principles on war crimes,
crimes against the peace, and crimes against humanity were adopted by the
General Assembly in 1948. By its action today, with resolution 808 (1993 ) the
Security Council has shown that the will of this Organization can be
exercised, even if it has taken nearly half a century for the wisdom of our
S/PV.3175
14
(Ms. Albright, United States)
earliest principles to take hold. I hope that it will not take another half
century to achieve the peace and security that will render the hideous crimes
we suspect have been committed strictly historical phenomena.
Mr, RICHARDSON (United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland):	We have been receiving for many months now continued reports of
massive breaches of international humanitarian law and human rights in
Bosnia. I want to mention in particular the abuse of women, the deliberate
obstruction of humanitarian relief convoys, the forcible movements of
population, the forcible surrender of property and the deliberate targeting of
civilian populations.
There has been an outburst of anger at these shocking developments. All
parties share responsibility for these breaches. We believe that the Serbs
have been most culpable in these hideous practices, but we also believe that
"all such actions must be condemned; they must be investigated; and the"
perpetrators must be called to account, whoever is responsible, throughout the
territory of the former Yugoslavia. Those who have perpetrated these shocking
breaches of international humanitarian law should be left in no doubt that
they will be held individually responsible for their actions.
We think it is vital that an international legal mechanism be established
to bring those accused of war crimes, from whatever party to the conflict, to
justice. Whatever mechanism is proposed to give effect to this resolution
should reflect this and should have jurisdiction over all of the parties. We
welcome the valuable work on possible mechanisms by the French and Italian
legal experts and by Ambassador Corell and his colleagues of the Conference on
Security and Co-operation in Europe. This work is a valuable contribution to
S/PV.3175
15
(Mr, Richardson, United Kingdom)
the study by the Secretary-General, which we have requested in the resolution
we have just adopted, of the most effective and feasible way of establishing a
tribunal or a court.
The Secretary-General's task will not be easy. The Commission of
Experts' interim report notes the difficulties of identifying the perpetrators
of these crimes. It is vital that whatever court or tribunal is established
be provided with the necessary evidence. The Commission must therefore be
given adequate resources to continue its work, and the Secretary-General will
need to take account of legal difficulties such as those I have mentioned in
examining the options to put to this Council.
The court is, of course, an ad hoc legal framework to deal with war
crimes committed only in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. In the
longer term, we shall continue to support the study by the International Law
Commission towards an international criminal court with general jurisdiction.
We hope that the Secretary-General will be able to carry out his examination
of the options for establishing a court as quickly as possible, consistent of
course with a thorough examination of the many problems that the reports so
far submitted have already identified. We look forward to his report to the
Council in the near future and we recognize, of course, that a further
resolution by this Council will be necessary once we have received the
Secretary-General's report.
S/PV.3175
16
Mr. VORONTSOV (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian):
Russia has pursued an unwavering course of putting an end to war crimes and
cannot remain indifferent to the flagrant mass violations of international
humanitarian law in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Murder, rape and
"""ethnic cleansing"" must cease immediately, and the guilty - whatever their"
affiliation - must be duly punished.
We believe that the Security Council's adoption of a resolution deciding
that an international tribunal shall be established for the prosecution of
persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law
committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia reflects the international
community's will to exert its influence on all parties to the conflict in
order to accelerate the peace process. The legal basis, status, composition
and powers of the international tribunal and the modalities for its
establishment and functioning will, as provided by the resolution, be decided
by the Council subsequently, on the basis of a report on the subject by the
Secretary-General. But even today the resolution should serve the purpose of
bringing to their senses those who are ready to sacrifice for the sake of
their political ambitions the lives and dignity of hundreds and thousands of
totally innocent people.
Nor should we forget that violations of international humanitarian law
are also taking place in the course of other armed conflicts. We believe that
the Council's adoption of today's resolution will also serve as a serious
warning to those guilty of mass crimes and flagrant violations of human rights
in other parts of the Irorld.
S/PV.3175
17
Mr. ARRIA (Venezuela) (interpretation from Spanish): When the
Nuremberg war-crimes tribunal began its work on 18 October 1945,
Judge Robert H. Jackson said that
"""This first trial of crimes against world peace places a very heavy"
responsibility upon us. The crimes we intend to condemn and punish were
so deliberate and so devastating that our civilization cannot allow them
"to be ignored, for mankind could not survive a repetition of such crimes."""
Not quite 48 years after the beginning of the Nuremberg trial, the world
is horrified to see that organized barbarism - which, it was thought, was
possible only in that age and could never be repeated - has come again, this
time before the eyes of all mankind. And unlike the experience of the past,
no one can escape his responsibility by claiming ignorance of the atrocities.
"The policies of scorched earth, of what was initially called ""ethnic"
"cleansing"" and today can more accurately be called ""ethnic extermination"", of"
concentration camps and of torture carried out by the Serb militias, who
resort even to the savage policy of raping women as a technique of war, have
attained sinister levels previously unthinkable to mankind. The authoritative
testimony given by Mr. Cornelio Sommaruga, President of the International
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and by Mr. David Andrews, former Foreign
Minister of Ireland, on behalf of the European Community, among other equally
qualified persons, leads to the clear conclusion that the rapes and other
crimes have become an instrument of war, not a consequence of war.
Many organizations such as ICRC and the European Community have issued
unequivocal statements on all the atrocities that have been and continue to be
"committed. Sarajevo remains a city under siege; the siege has lasted"
"10 terrible months; the cemetery cannot hold, all the dead, and it is now"
S/PV.3175
18
(Mr, Arria, Venezuela)
necessary to bury them in the sports stadium. The survivors bury their dead
without ceremony.
Medical centres are the scene of daily horrors: the horror of individual
tragedies and the horror of the collective tragedy of having no way and no
materials to help the victims of these systematic killings.
In that connection, former United States Secretary of State
Lawrence Eagleburger himself has suggested to world public opinion the names
of the most prominent candidates for trial by the future war-crimes tribunal.
Venezuela believes that the resolution we have just adopted is consistent
with the principles and the plan of action agreed to by all parties concerned
in the context of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia and
that it is also consistent with the provisions of Article 41 of the Charter.
My delegation congratulates the Government of France on its initiative in
submitting to the Council the draft resolution adopted today.
We eagerly await the specific recommendations the Secretary-General will
present to the Council, with a view to activating the machinery. If the
purpose of that machinery is to be fully achieved, there must also be very
substantial support for the Commission of Experts established by the Council,
so that the Commission may complete its work of laying the foundations for the
process to be advanced by the war-crimes tribunal.
Mr, ERDOS (Hungary) (interpretation from French): One of the most
tragic, grim and alarming aspects of the bloody conflict in the former
Yugoslavia is the planned and systematic mass violation of the most elementary
norms of international humanitarian law. Since the end of the Second World
War, Europe has not known such terrible upheavals or human-rights violations
of such magnitude and such cruelty.
S/PV.3175
19-20
(Mr. Erdos, Hungary)
It is the view of world public opinion that efforts to bring to justice
those responsible for these crimes must be an integral part of a broad
endeavour to achieve a just and lasting settlement of the entire conflict that
is now savaging the former Yugoslavia.	.
As in 1945, the conscience of Europe and the world cannot allow those who
have ordered and committed violations of international humanitarian law - and
who cynically and blindly continue to do so - to escape justice.
The way the international community deals with questions relating to the
events in the former Yugoslavia will leave a profound mark on the future of
that part of Europe, and beyond. It will make either easier or more painful,
or even impossible, the healing of the psychological wounds the conflict has
inflicted upon peoples who for centuries have lived together in harmony and
good-neighbourliness, regardless of what we may hear today from certain
parties to the conflict. We cannot forget that the peoples, the ethnic .
communities and the national minorities of Central and Eastern Europe are
watching us and following our work with close attention.
The results of our activities, whether positive or negative, our
successes or our failures within the United Nations and the Security Council,
will inevitably have repercussions and direct effects upon that entire part of
the world and, I am convinced, elsewhere too.
S/PV.3175
21
(Mr. Erdos, Hungary)
We consider that the Security Council's decision of last October to set
up a Commission of Experts charged with studying and analysing information on
the grave violations of international humanitarian law in the former
Yugoslavia is of great importance. Information and reports from various
sources confirm and strengthen our conviction that the gravity and massive
nature of these violations constitute a threat to international peace and
security. Consequently, there should be no doubt about the competence of the
Security Council to deal with this matter. Resolution 808 (1993) contains a
clear and unequivocal political message for those who are responsible and who
are committing almost-unimaginable crimes.
Hungary is ready, when the time comes, to embark on the second stage of
our work, which will be the report of the Secretary-General containing
concrete proposals and options for the implementation of the resolution that
the Council has solemnly adopted today.
. Mr, YA.NEZ-BARNUEVO (Spain) (interpretation from Spanish): The
Council has recently taken decisions of great import, but few deserve to be
"called ""historic"" as much as the resolution we have just adopted. Indeed, as"
the provisional report of the Commission of Experts established by Security
Council resolution 780 (1992) clearly states, this is the first time the
Security Council has decided to establish a tribunal to try those deemed
responsible for grave violations of international humanitarian law perpetrated
in an armed conflict - in this instance, the grave acts committed in the
territory of the former Yugoslavia. In that provisional report, the
Commission concludes that grave offences and other violations of international
"humanitarian law have been committed, including murder, ""ethnic cleansing"","
mass killings, torture, rape, looting and destruction of civilian property,
destruction of cultural and religious property and arbitrary detention.
S/PV.3175
22
(Mr, Yanez-Barnuevo, Spain)
We understand that some may harbour certain doubts about the competence
of the Council to take this step, for it is a novel one. However, we do not
share those doubts. We understand that this is a limited and precise action
with the clear objective of restoring peace, which is perfectly in keeping
with the competence of the Council. In fact, the Council is not attempting to
establish any new jurisdictional or legislative framework of a permanent
nature. It is not setting itself up as a permanent judge or legislator. It
is only attempting to create an ad hoc mechanism that, by applying existing
laws, will assign responsibility for acts committed in an ongoing conflict
"that has already been seen to threaten and undermine peace; a mechanism that"
contributes, by means of recourse to justice and punishment of the guilty, to
restoring the peace and ensuring its maintenance, so as to deter the
repetition of similar acts in the future.
For these reasons, the States members of the European Community have on
various occasions declared themselves to be in favour of the establishment of
an international criminal tribunal for the prosecution of those engaged in
such grave misconduct.
Spain would have preferred the establishment of a criminal tribunal with
universal jurisdiction, but it recognizes that to create one would have
required more time than is now at our disposal if we wish to contribute to the
early restoration of peace in the former Yugoslavia. Nevertheless, we are
confident that this is the first step towards the future creation of an
international, universal, permanent criminal jurisdiction, and we shall
continue to support and promote the efforts towards this end now being made in
other forums within this Organization.

(Mr, Yanez-Barnuevo, Spain)
While we are aware of the need to act swiftly in order that the
establishment of an international criminal tribunal on the former Yugoslavia
fulfils its dual objective of meting out justice and discouraging such grave
violations in the future, we believe that this undertaking is so important and
so sensitive that it is necessary to ensure the maximum respect for legal
rigour in its functioning. We therefore fully support a two-stage process,
such as the one we are initiating today, in which, following the adoption of a
decision in principle, a thorough, detailed study is conducted so that the
institution established will live up to the expectations of the international
community and will meet all the requirements of full respect for international
law. It is imperative that norms relating to human rights be respected, in
particular the rights of defence. It is also essential to resolve difficult
questions such as the nature of the sentences to be imposed, the places they
are to be served, the statutes of the organs entrusted with the investigation
and the indictment, the possibility of appealing the decisions of the tribunal
and other questions of no less importance.
From the foregoing, it is clear that there is a tremendous amount of work
to be done. We have no doubt that the Secretary-General, to whom we entrust
this enormous task, will carry it out with his characteristic speed and
effectiveness. In so doing he will have at his disposal some excellent
studies that have already been done - and here I wish to mention those
prepared by expert jurists from France and Italy and by an ad hoc Committee of
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which have already been
distributed as Security Council documents - and the full cooperation, I have
no doubt, of all the States Members of the United Nations and those bodies
competent in the field of international law that the Secretary-General deems
it appropriate to consult. From this moment we shall await with great

(Mr, Yanez-Barnuevax_-££aia)
interest the result of his labours, with its concrete proposals for the
Council regarding the organization, operation and other points pertaining to
the smooth functioning of the tribunal.
We have stated that the establishment of the tribunal will contribute, in
our view, to the restoration and maintenance of peace in accordance with the
principles of justice and international law. At the same time, we wish to
recall that it is not an attempt to supplant the bold efforts currently under
way for the achievement of a just and lasting political agreement. Genuine
peace must be founded on justice and, at the same time, a dialogue that
ensures that the parties involved agree to the terms of any solution to the
underlying problems of the former Yugoslavia.

(Mr, Yanez-Barnuevo, Spain)
For all those reasons we encourage the two Co-Chairmen of the Steering
Committee of the International Conference to continue their efforts to bring
about agreement between all the parties to the conflict. We pledge our full
cooperation to that end. Crimes such as those committed in the territory of
the former Yugoslavia should never remain unpunished. By its decision today,
the Security Council has made that crystal clear. All those responsible for
such acts are therefore warned of the international community's resolve.
Mr. O'BRIEN (New Zealand)t It is indeed a momentous decision that
the Council has taken this morning. We owe a great deal, Mr. President, to
your skill and purpose in getting the resolution adopted. Our decision has
not been taken lightly. No one can deny the enormity of the crimes, of which
previous speakers have spoken very eloquently. No one can deny the deep
significance of the issues that must guide the Council in its follow-up to its
decision today.
New Zealand has long supported the principle of international criminal
jurisdiction. Therefore, we stand ready with others to offer a contribution
to the Secretary-General's upcoming important work on the basis of which the
Council will take a decision about the further vital matter of the actual
tribunal machinery for the territory of the former Republic of Yugoslavia. We
believe that it is absolutely essential that the Council, having taken this
significant decision today, proceed with purpose and resolve to translate the
decision into practical and effective results on the basis of the
"Secretary-General's proposal; in our opinion, the momentum must not be allowed"
to diminish.

The PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): I shall now make a
statement in my capacity as representative of my country.
My country has just participated responsibly and following its conscience
in the adoption of the resolution, which confirms the will of the Security
Council not to allow to go unpunished all the horrible crimes in Bosnia and
Herzegovina that we have been hearing about for several months. Not content
with carrying out a disgraceful genocide, the Serbs have systematically
perpetrated a whole range of atrocities, torture and violence, all of them
totally inadmissible, acts and practices that we had thought belonged to a
bygone age.
In establishing the principle of a war crimes tribunal, the Council is
responding to the unanimous wish of the international community, which for
almost two years has been deploring and condemning the acts in question and
strongly calling for punishment and action.
The step we have taken is serious. Until yesterday the crimes continued
unabated. Today the criminals know they will be pursued and punished. This
"warning is important with regard to those who have respected no moral values;"
it will surely deter those who are afraid only of force. Let us hope that our
action will be followed by deterrent steps. Perhaps it will then finally be
understood in the former Yugoslavia that resolutions are passed to be
respected and that human life is to be safeguarded and protected.
I hardly need repeat our congratulations to the French delegation on its
valuable contribution to the establishment of peace and harmony. I hope that
the historic action we have just taken will mark the beginning of a return to
'wisdom in a region that has suffered too much death and upheaval.	■
I now resume my functions as President.
