ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
The agenda was adopted.
FURTHER REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL PURSUANT TO SECURITY COUNCIL
RESOLUTION 743 (1992) (S/25264 and Corr.l)
"The PRESIDENT (interpretation from French); I should like to inform"
the Council that I have received a letter from the representative of Croatia
in which he requests to be invited to participate in the discussion of the
item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that representative to
participate in the discussion without the right to vote, in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the Council's
provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Nobilo (Croatia) took a place at
the Council table.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): I have also received a
request dated 19 February 1993 from Ambassador Dragomir Djokic to address the
Council. With the consent of the Council, I would propose to invite him to
address the Council in the course of the discussion of the item before it.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
The Security Council will now begin its consideration of the item on the
agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the further report of the
Secretary-General pursuant to Security Council resolution 743 (1992), which is
contained in document S/25264 and Corr.l.
S/PV.3174
3-5
(The President)
Members of the Council also have before them document S/25306, which
contains the text of a draft resolution prepared in the course of the
Council's prior consultations.
I should like to draw the attention of members of the Council to the
following documents: S/25062 and S/25288, letters dated 5 January and
12 February 1993, respectively, from the Permanent Representative of Croatia
"to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General; S/25193, S/25218 and"
S/25237, letters dated 29 January and 1 and 3 February from the Charge
d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Yugoslavia to the United Nations,
the first addressed to the Secretary-General and the others to the President
"of the Security Council; S/25222, letter dated 26 January 1993 from the"
Permanent Representatives of France, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations addressed to the President
"of the Security Council; and S/25246, letter dated 5 February 1993 from the"
Permanent Representative of Turkey to the United Nations addressed to the
Secretary-General.
The first speaker is the representative of Croatia, on whom I now call.
Mr, NOBILO (Croatia): My Government is grateful for the opportunity
to express the official position of the Republic of Croatia regarding
prolongations of the United Nations peace operation on its territory.
I have instructions from my Government to support the Secretary-General's
proposals for the provisional extension of the mandate of the United Nations
Protection Force (UNPROFOR) up to 31 March 1993. This will provide enough
time for substantial negotiations concerning all the aspects of the UNPROFOR
operation and for full implementation of the Vance plan.
S/PV.3174
6
(Mr, Nobilo, Croatia)
I should like to refer to my letter dated 12 February 1993 (S/25288) to
the Secretary-General and stress once again the basic elements on which future
United Nations operations in the Republic of Croatia must be based: complete
"demilitarization of the United Nations protected areas and ""pink zones"";"
"voluntary return of the refugees; control of Croatian international borders;"
confidence-building measures as a part of the process of reintegration of
"these areas into the Croatian State and its society; and protection of the"
rights of national minorities and other human rights.
The Republic of Croatia is prepared to implement Security Council
resolution 802 ( 1993) as a first step in the demilitarization process that
will be fully established through the implementation of Security Council
resolutions 762 (1992) and 769 (1992) and that will enable a comprehensive
political solution to be reached under the auspices of the Conference on the
Former Yugoslavia.
Croatia finds that Security Council resolutions have been of crucial
importance in stopping the aggression against my country. The Croatian
Government is fully confident that the future decisions of this body will give
added credibility to the UNPROFOR operation and provide it with effective
mechanisms so that it can attain all the goals foreseen in the Vance plan. We
firmly believe that international guarantees for the implementation of
Security Council resolutions are of the utmost importance in bringing peace to
the Republic of Croatia, as well as to the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): in accordance with the
decision taken earlier in the meeting, I now invite Ambassador Dragomir Djokic
to take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
✓
Ml_s—PJOKI_C: The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has accepted the
Vance plan, fully supports it and has invested efforts in its complete
S/PV.3174
7
(Mr, Djokic)
implementation. For its part, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has
fulfilled all obligations undertaken under the plan, but further efforts need
to be made so that other signatories do likewise.
The United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) peace-keeping operation
has proved to be justified, thus creating the basic prerequisites for all open
questions to be resolved. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia supports further
engagement of UNPROFOR and most energetically demands that Security Council
resolution 802 (1993) be fully implemented.
Our position from the very beginning has been that a durable and just
solution can be reached only through dialogue between the parties directly
"involved; mutual respect for each other's interests; cooperation; and"
political goodwill.
We shall also continue in the future to contribute our share to the
Geneva Conference, despite the unjust and one-sided sanctions imposed on us
that punish one nation as a whole, which we expect to be lifted soon.
I should like to recall that the Vance plan states:
"""Subject to the Council's agreement, the operation would remain in"
"Yugoslavia until a negotiated settlement of the conflict was achieved."""
(S/23280, annex III, para, 5)
The Secretary-General was even more specific in his report of 4 February 1992,
saying:
"""the United Nations force would not be withdrawn before an overall"
"political solution was found to the Yugoslav crisis"". (S/23513 ."
para, 9 (a))
Those goals have not yet been attained. Negotiations on an overall
settlement of the Yugoslav crisis are under way within the framework of the
International Conference, and peace is conditio sine qua non for its success.
S/PV.3174
8
(Mr, Djokic)
Moreover, the local population in Krajina needs United Nations protection now
more than ever. For those reasons, the continuing role of UNPROFOR is
essential at this crucial juncture.	'
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had expected UNPROFOR's mandate to be
extended for a longer period of time rather than a short interim period. The
basic goals of UNPROFOR's mandate are to protect the local population in the
protected areas and to create the conditions of peace and security required
for the negotiation of an overall settlement of the Yugoslav crisis.
The responsibility for the non-implementation of the peace plan rests
primarily with the Republic of Croatia. Only recently, it launched a major
military attack against the United Nations protected areas. It has violated
cease-fires on many occasions, infiltrated terrorist groups in protected areas
and amassed troops on the borders of those protected areas.
The aggression of the Croatian Army against the United Nations protected
areas, UNPROFOR and the Serbian civilian population represents a flagrant
violation of the Vance peace plan and relevant Security Council resolutions,
in particular 724 (1991) and 762 (1992). That has seriously jeopardized the
credibility of the United Nations and its ability to defend the population and
ensure peace in the territories under its protection.
Furthermore, the Republic of Croatia has totally ignored the latest
Security Council resolution, 802 (1993), as well as the presidential statement
of 27 January 1993 and the demands contained therein - to immediately cease
all military activities and withdraw its army to the original positions.
Quite to the contrary, it has continued and stepped up its aggression
against the United Nations protected areas. President Tudjman has even gone
so far as to publicly announce, on 31 January 1993, that Croatian troops would
go ahead and capture more of the United Nations protected areas.
S/PV.3174
9-10
(Mr, Djokic)
In that regard, we should like to recall that the Security Council has
undertaken to consider
"""... what further steps might be necessary to ensure that resolution"
802 (1993) and other relevant Security Council resolutions are fully
"implemented."" (S/PV.3165, p, 3)"
These developments and permanent armed provocations on the part of the
Republic of Croatia are a serious impediment to the complete demilitarization
of the protected areas and to the implementation of the peace plan.
The Serbs, in those parts of the protected areas controlled by the
"Croatian Army, have been subjected to a systematic ""ethnic cleansing"" that is"
proportionately huge in relation to the size of the territory and the number
of people it affected. In the region of Western Slavonia alone, 180 villages
"were completely ""cleansed"" of Serbs, and, as a result, more than 200,000 Serbs"
from Croatia sought refuge in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
The present policy of the Republic of Croatia is undoubtedly a major
obstacle to finding a peaceful and durable solution to the Yugoslav crisis.
The victims of that policy are no longer only the Serbs but also the Muslims
and United Nations forces.
Since the outbreak of the conflict, 60,000 soldiers of the Croatian Army
have been actively engaged in the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as has been
confirmed by the United Nations Secretary-General, the Security Council and
the General Assembly. Croatia has, in effect, expanded its authority to the
territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina under its occupation.
S/PV.3174
' 11
(Mr, Djokic)
The Republic of Croatia has openly violated the arms embargo imposed by
Security Council resolution 713 (1991). Croatian territory is also being used
for channeling arms to the Croats and Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina. That
has been documented and reported by the world media, many independent
observers and international organizations.
The letter from the President of the Republic of Croatia of
9 December 1992 addressed to the President of the Security Council raised very
serious concerns about the intentions and willingness of the Republic of
Croatia to honour the commitments it has accepted under the Vance peace plan. '
In that letter, President Tudjman even proposed that the United Nations takes
"""efficient steps' resembling those taken in the case of aggression against"
"Kuwait and with regard to the present-day situation in Somalia"""
and that it:
"""Authorize UNPROFOR to implement its task within the scope of the Vance"
"Plan, if necessary by use of force as well"". (S/24934, para, 6)"
Such positions represent a clear departure from the commitments and
obligations arising from the Vance peace plan. The proposals contained in the
letter are fraught with grave dangers for the situation on the ground and
could jeopardize further implementation of the peace plan.
The present policy pursued by Croatia is not only in contravention of the
peace plan but also in defiance of the relevant Security Council resolutions.
It should be recalled that President Tudjman, in his letter addressed to the
Secretary-General of 6 February 1992, accepted fully and unconditionally the
Secretary-General's concept and plan which defined the conditions and areas
where the United Nations forces were to be deployed. Security Council
resolution 740 (1992) of 7 February 1992 noted that President Tudjman's
S/PV.3174
12
(Mr, Djokic)
unconditional acceptance removed an obstacle to the deployment of the
peace-keeping operation.
The role of the Republic of Croatia has often been ignored in the
deliberations within the Security Council, and its responsibility brushed
aside. As a result, the Republic of Croatia has been further encouraged to
persist with its policy and practice of aggression, which has been
particularly evident lately.
The Security Council can no longer let such a policy stand without firm
response. It has an obligation to take all appropriate measures, including
those envisaged by Chapter VII, to make the Republic of Croatia honour the
United Nations Charter and all relevant Security Council resolutions. If the
Security Council truly seeks to contribute to the peaceful resolution of the
Yugoslav crisis, it should take an impartial attitude towards all parties to
the conflict. If it fails to do so, the Security Council would embolden
Croatia's apparent aspirations to the military option and make a peaceful
solution ever so distant and unattainable.
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has declared on many occasions that it
will strictly abide by all the commitments that the Socialist Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia assumed internationally. Therefore, it shall respect and fulfil
the rights and obligations the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
undertook .vis-a-vis the territories of Krajina that have been placed, within
the framework of the United Nations peace-keeping operation, under the
protection of the world Organization.
Although the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia considers that UNPROFOR's
mandate should have been extended for a year, we support the proposal
contained in the draft resolution that, for the time being, it be extended
until 31 March 1993 . We hope that the necessary conditions will be created in
S/PV.3174
13
(Mr, Diokic)
the meantime so that UNPROFOR's mandate can be further extended, as envisioned
by the plan, until a comprehensive and peaceful solution is reached.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): It is my understanding
that the Security Council is ready to proceed to the vote on the draft
resolution before it. If I hear no objection, I shall take it that that is
the case.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
Before putting the draft resolution to the vote, I shall call on those
members of the Council who wish to make statements before the voting.
Mr, MERIMEE (France) (interpretation from French): For the past
year, the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) has striven to keep the
peace in Croatia under extremely difficult conditions. For the past six
months, it has, in a hostile environment, protected the delivery of
humanitarian aid in Bosnia and Herzegovina. For the past few weeks, it has
been preventing the conflict from spreading to Macedonia. Thus, the tasks
assigned it are immense. Regrettably, the results are not always up to the
expectations of the international community. This mixed picture should not
allow us to forget the exemplary manner in which the men committed to this
operation have been serving. They do so every day at the risk of losing their
lives. For our part, we are well aware of the dangers, since the French
contingent has lost 12 members. I would therefore, at the outset, like to pay
a tribute to the courage of all the Blue Helmets of UNPROFOR and to the memory
of those who have fallen.
These preliminary comments illustrate why the security of the forces were
a priority consideration to my Government when the question of renewing the
mandate of UNPROFOR arose. The tragic events of the past few weeks in Croatia
have only strengthened our feeling that there is an overriding need to endow
S/PV.3174
14-15
(Mr, Merimee, France)
this Force with both the legal basis and the military means effectively to
ensure its self-defence. We would have preferred that this be done on a
lasting basis. Considering the circumstances, recognise that the six-week
extension is the Council's only possible option. But even for a brief interim
period, it was unthinkable to us that we extend the present mandate in its
current form.
It was in that spirit that my delegation proposed a substantive and
ambitious draft resolution that places UNPROFOR within the framework of
Chapter VII of the Charter and suggested a series of concrete measures aimed
at ensuring greater stability in the areas where UNPROFOR is deployed. As to
the reference to Chapter VII, I reiterate' once again that our idea is not to
change the nature of the Force, that is, to move from peace-keeping to
peacemaking. We are moved solely by considerations of preventive security.
Indeed, this is reflected in the text of the draft resolution before us.
The French delegation hopes that the Council will take this approach and
do so unanimously. It would thus provide a striking demonstration of its
solidarity with the soldiers of UNPROFOR who are implementing the its
decisions in the field. At the same time, it would send to the parties
concerned a signal of its determination to. ensure respect for its decisions.
Sir David HANNAY (United Kingdom): My Government has been deeply
concerned at the continuation of fighting in various parts of the former
Yugoslavia and in particular at the flare-up recently in Croatia. I would
also like to express the deep distress my Government felt at the losses that
the United Nations forces have sustained, and in particular those sustained by
the French contingent, which have been of a very serious nature.
S/PV.3174
16
(Sir David Hannav,
In our view, it is absolutely essential that we establish respect and
protection for United Nations forces in the field. That, in our view, fully
justifies the changes contained in this draft resolution. These, as the
French Ambassador says, are designed for self-defence only and in our view are
entirely justified.
We strongly support also the new political remit that the
Secretary-General has suggested, and that the Council has endorsed, giving to
the two Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International Conference
on the Former Yugoslavia. It is essential that we get full compliance with
Security Council resolution 802 (1993), so far as concerns both the withdrawal
of Croatian forces and the re-placing under United Nations control of the
heavy weapons.
We hope that the talks that Mr. Vance and Lord Owen are now undertaking
will lead to progress on the implementation of the Vance plan, and within that
to the definition of the status of Krajina within the Republic of Croatia -
and I shall repeat that phrase, because I heard from one of the participants
in this debate words that seemed to imply something different - within the
Republic of Croatia.
Increasingly, links between what is going on in Bosnia and Herzegovina
and what is going on in Croatia are becoming evident. It is as urgent to make
progress in the peace process for Bosnia and Herzegovina as in implementing
the Vance plan in Croatia. I feel that the next mandate renewal, which we
have foreseen for the end of March, will be a crucial moment in that respect.
S/PV.3174
17
(Sir David Hannav,
United Kingdom)
Finally, I should say that my Government strongly supports the proposal
by the Secretary-General to put the financing of all United Nations
peace-keeping operations in the former Yugoslavia on a full United Nations
basis of assessed contributions. In our view, peace-keeping is a
responsibility of the whole international community, and it should be financed
by the whole membership of the United Nations.
' Mr, YANEZ BARNUEVO (Spain) (interpretation from Spanish): Since
this is my delegation’s first Council statement this month, I should like to
begin by congratulating you, Sir, on the courteous and effective manner in
which you have been conducting our debates. We wish also to express our
appreciation to Ambassador Hatano of Japan for the way in which he guided the
work of the Council in January.
We wish also to thank the Secretary-General for his excellent report
(S/25264), which in a clear, balanced and realistic manner describes the
difficult situation faced by the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)
"both in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina; the report has been prepared"
shortly before the expiration of UNPROFOR’s mandate, as provided for in
resolution 743 (1992).
On the whole, my delegation shares the views the Secretary-General sets
out in his report. We are fully aware of the need for a sound basis on which
to renew the mandate of UNPROFOR in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We
therefore support the extension of UNPROFOR’s mandate for an interim period
ending 31 March 1993. It is our firm hope that before that date there will be
a positive result to the ongoing talks, led by the Co-Chairmen of the Steering
Committee of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, between
S/PV.3174
18
(Mr, Yanez Barnuevo, Spain)
representatives of the Republic of Croatia and of the Serb populations living
in the United Nations protected areas and in adjacent areas in Croatia.
We remind the parties of their responsibilities in this regard and of the
need fully to implement all provisions of the relevant Security Council
resolutions, including the most recent, resolution 802 (1993). We also stress
that they must cooperate fully with Mr. Vance and Lord Owen, whose tireless
efforts we support without reservation, in quickly reaching an agreement on
full compliance with the United Nations peace plan in Croatia.
In the meantime, and in view of the recent tragic events in Croatia, my
Government shares the concern of the Secretary-General and of countries whose
troops are deployed in Croatia. We support the decision to take the measures
necessary to ensure the safety of UNPROFOR personnel and to ensure complete
respect by all parties for the Force as it carries out its mandate.
"The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is no less disturbing; this is"
reflected in the report of the Secretary-General. The people of that Republic
are subjected to terrible hardships, now exacerbated by the unacceptable
obstacles and restrictions imposed by various parties on the delivery of
humanitarian assistance by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees with the assistance of UNPROFOR.
We state firmly that the relevant Security Council resolutions must be
implemented with respect to UNPROFOR's mandate and operations in that
Republic. The parties, and all others concerned, must at all times respect
the unrestricted freedom of movement of UNPROFOR forces. The infantry
batallion provided by Spain as a contribution to UNPROFOR efforts in Bosnia
S/PV.3174
19
(Mr, Yanez Barnuevo, Spain)
and Herzegovina is performing commendable work in protecting convoys carrying
humanitarian assistance, and doing so in extremely difficult and dangerous
conditions.
My Government wants to state very clearly that the safety of UNPROFOR
personnel must be fully guaranteed, and we must condemn any action or measures
taken by parties to the conflict that could obstruct or endanger the delivery
of humanitarian assistance, including threats to the lives of those who are
attempting to help the civilian population. That has been reiterated in
several Security Council statements in recent weeks.
Finally, we agree with the Secretary-General's recommendation that, from
the next renewal of the mandate of UPROFOR following this interim period, all
UNPROFOR activities in the former Yugoslavia be financed by assessed	’
contributions from all Member States in line with the scale of assessments
established for peace-keeping operations.
For all those reasons, we shall vote in favour of draft resolution
S/25306.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): I thank the
representative of Spain for the kind words he addressed to me.
Mr, CHEN Jian (China) (interpretation from Chinese): First of all,
Sir, please allow me to congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency
of the Security Council for February. I am confident that, with your rich
experience, wisdom and talent, you will successfully guide the work of the
Security Council this month.
S/PV.3174
20
(Mr, Chen Jian, China)
I should like to take this opportunity also to thank His Excellency
Mr. Yoshio Hatano, Permanent Representative of Japan, for his outstanding
performance as he guided us through the work of the Security Council last
month.
Almost a year has passed since the adoption of Security Council
resolution 743 (1992), which established the United Nations Protection Force
(UNPROFOR) in the former Yugoslavia. It is regrettable, however, that we have
been witnessing there an escalation of the armed conflict and a sharp increase
in the number of displaced persons. At the same time, humanitarian relief
efforts are still being obstructed. This leads to huge losses of life and
property, and to greater suffering. We should like to express our deep
concern about this situation.
The Chinese delegation appreciates the further report of the
Secretary-General pursuant to Security Council resolution 743 (1992), and
agrees to the extension of UNPROFOR1s mandate for an interim period
terminating on 31 March 1993. We hope that during this period the Co-Chairmen
of the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the Former
Yugoslavia will conduct full consultations with all parties concerned and will
make early progress on a negotiated political solution to the issue of the
former Yugoslavia. At the same time we are much concerned at the fact that
the security of UNPROFOR's personnel is under constant threat. We also
understand the concerns expressed by the troop-contributing States in that
regard.
S/PV.3174
21
(Mr. Chen Jian, China)
We therefore support the Secretary-General's taking appropriate measures,
in consultation with the force-contributing States, to strengthen the security
of UNPROFOR personnel. Meanwhile, we urge all the parties to the conflict to
cooperate with UNPROFOR to ensure the safety of its personnel.
Proceeding from the above statement and considering that the sponsor
country has repeatedly stated that the purpose of invoking Chapter VII of the
United Nations Charter in this draft resolution is to take measures to
increase appropriately UNPROFOR's self-defence capability, the Chinese
delegation will vote in favour of this draft resolution. Nevertheless, it
must be pointed out that UNPROFOR in Croatia is a peace-keeping operation, and
Chapter VII was not invoked either in resolution 743 (1992) or in subsequent
resolutions relating to this matter. Nor does the current report of the •
Secretary-General contain any such request. With regard to the safety of
UNPROFOR personnel, the question can be settled through the expanded concept
of self-defence and rules of engagement and by taking other appropriate
measures without invoking Chapter VII. We should therefore like to express
our reservations on invoking Chapter VII in this draft resolution. We should
like to put on record the understanding that the practice of invoking
Chapter VII in this draft resolution is an exceptional case and therefore does
not constitute a precedent for future United Nations peace-keeping operations.
Mr, VORONTSOV (Russian Federation) (interpretation from Russian):
The adoption by the Security Council of the draft resolution before it to
temporarily extend the mandate of the United Nations Protection Force
(UNPROFOR) should, in the opinion of the Russian Federation, send a clear
signal to all those involved in the conflict in the territory of former
Yugoslavia to the effect that the United Nations is firmly opposed to any
S/PV.3174
22
(Mr, Vorontsov, Russian Federation)
continuation of hostilities and further bloodshed, and that it favours the
prompt achievement of a peace settlement.
In this connection we believe that the' demand contained in the draft
resolution for the rapid implementation of resolution 802 (1993) and other
resolutions previously adopted by the Security Council is extremely
important. It is important to recall that resolution 802 (1993) clearly
states that it is essential not only that an end be put to hostilities on the
part of the Croatian armed forces in the United Nations protected areas or in
proximity to them but also that Croatian armed forces be withdrawn from those
regions. Naturally, it is essential that the remaining provisions of the
United Nations peace plan in Croatia be.observed and complied with by all
parties.
It has been our constant endeavour to exert a balanced influence on all
those involved in the Yugoslav crisis, in the interest of its prompt
settlement. We believe that, should Croatia fail to meet the demands
contained in resolution 802 (1993) and other Security Council resolutions,
sanctions under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter should also be
applied to Croatia.
The Russian delegation would also like to point out that an important
prerequisite for maintaining United Nations forces in their place of
deployment is that of ensuring their safety. It is extremely distressing that
among the service personnel of the contingents of UNPROFOR, including its
Russian members, there have been casualties. It is therefore very timely and
appropriate that the draft resolution contains provisions intended to prevent
any attempts on the lives of those who wear the blue helmet or other
representatives of the United Nations responsible for carrying out an
extremely noble humanitarian mission.
S/PV.3174
23
(Mr, Vorontsov, Russian Federation)
Throughout this entire conflict in former Yugoslavia, the Russian
Federation has been actively involved in efforts by the international
community to achieve a peace settlement. Russia intends to do everything
necessary to ensure that the current stage in the negotiations headed by the
Co-Chairmen of the Geneva process, Mr. Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, leads to a
successful outcome that will enable us, as soon as possible, to determine the
role of United Nations forces with respect to the conditions of such a
settlement.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from French): I shall now put to the
vote the draft resolution contained in document S/25306.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:	Brazil, Cape Verde, China, Djibouti, France, Hungary, Japan,
Morocco, New Zealand, Pakistan, Russian Federation, Spain,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
United States of America, Venezuela
