EXPRESSION OF THANKS TO THE RETIRING PRESIDENT
The PRESIDENT: I should like at the outset of this meeting to take
the opportunity to pay tribute, on behalf of my Council colleagues, to His
Excellency Sir David Hannay, Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the United Nations, for his outstanding
service as President of the Security Council for the month of July. I am sure
I speak for all the members of the Security Council in expressing our deep
appreciation to Ambassador Hannay for the great diplomatic skill and unfailing
courtesy with which he conducted the Council's business last month.

(The President)
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them document S/26263, which contains
the text of a draft resolution submitted by France, Hungary, Spain, the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of
America. Members of the Council also have before them documents S/26121 and
S/26148, which contain the text of letters dated 20 and 23 July 1993,
respectively, from the Charge d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of
Sweden to the United Nations, addressed to the President of the Security
Council.
I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to the
following other documents: S/26210, letter dated 28 July 1993 from the Charge
d'affaires a.i.of the Permanent Mission of Yugoslavia to the United Nations
addressed to the Secretary-General and S/26234, letter dated 3 August 1993
from the Charge d'affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of Yugoslavia to the
United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General.
It is my understanding that the Security Council is ready to proceed to
the vote on the draft resolution before it. If I hear no objection, I shall
take it that that is the case.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
Before putting the draft resolution to the vote, I shall call on those
members of the Council who wish to make statements before the voting.
Mr, LI Zhaoxing (China) (interpretation from Chinese):
Madam President, please allow me to congratulate you on your assumption of the
presidency of the Council for this month. You are the only ambassadress in
the Council, and I am confident that your outstanding talent and rich
S/PV.3262
4
(Mr, Li Zhaoxinq, China)
experience will surely lead the work of the Council to success this month. I
would also like to thank your predecessor, His Excellency Sir David Hannay,
for his effectiveness and efficiency, which have left a deep impression on us.
The Chinese delegation is of the view that the issue of Kosovo is an
internal affair of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The sovereignty,
political independence and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia should be respected in line with the basic principles of the United
Nations Charter and international law. Based on this consideration, we
believe that the Council, in handling this issue, should exercise extreme
prudence and act in strict conformity with the purposes and principles of the
Charter, especially the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs
of sovereign States.
We have noted that recently the United Nations and the relevant regional
organizations have played an increasingly important role in engaging in
preventive diplomacy and other activities. Preventive diplomacy, as part of
the pacific settlement of conflicts embodied in Chapter VI of the Charter,
should be carried out at the explicit request, or with the prior consent, of
the States and parties concerned. It should never be imposed against their
will.
Practice over the years has shown that the consent and cooperation of the
parties concerned are essential factors in ensuring the success of the
endeavours of the United Nations and regional organizations.
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) missions to
Kosovo and other areas of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were sent at the
beginning with the consent of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The present
dispute between the two sides over whether the missions should be continued
S/PV.3262
5
(Mr. Li Zhaoxinq, China)
should therefore be solved through continued dialogue and consultation between
them. Any outside interference or pressure will not be helpful in finding a
proper solution, and may only further complicate the issue.
We also wish to point out that when differences arise between a regional
organization and a sovereign State the question whether the Security Council
should involve itself and, if it is necessary to do so, what principle should
guide its action is indeed an important one for us to ponder.
My delegation, in the spirit of seeking common ground and consensus, had
offered specific amendments to the draft resolution in line with the
principles I have mentioned. However, it is very much regrettable that they
have not been accepted. We will therefore have to abstain in the vote on this
draft resolution.
"The PRESIDENT; I thank the representative of China for his kind"
words addressed to me.
I shall now put to the vote the draft resolution in document S/26263.
A vote was taken by show of hands.
In favour:;"Brazil, Cape Verde, Djibouti, France,
Hungary, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand,
Pakistan, Russian Federation, Spain, United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, United States of America, Venezuela"
Aqainst:;None
Abstaininq:;China
The PRESIDENT: The result of the voting is as follows: 14 in
favour, none against and one abstention. The draft resolution has been
adopted as resolution 855 (1993).
I shall now call on those members of the Council who wish to make
statements following the voting.
S/PV.3262
5 (a-z)
Mr. BUDAI (Hungary): The delegation of Hungary shares the deep
concern over the refusal of the Belgrade Government to allow the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) missions of long duration in
Vojvodina, Kosovo and Sandjak to continue their activities.
The missions were established to promote dialogue between the authorities
and communities in the three regions, collect information on human rights
violations and promote solutions to such problems as well as to assist in
providing information on relevant legislation on human rights, protection of
minorities, free media and democratic elections. As the Chairman-in-Office of
the Council of Ministers of the CSCE points out in her letter of 20 July 1993
to the President of the Security Council, the missions have indeed proved
extremely valuable in promoting stability and counteracting the risk of
ethnically motivated violence in Kosovo, Sandjak and Vojvodina. My delegation
fully shares this assessment of the role of the CSCE missions.
In fact, we strongly believe that transparency in the protection of human
rights is an important factor of stability and security, being a litmus test
of a Government's fulfilment of its obligations under the United Nations
Charter and other relevant international instruments.
S/PV.3262
6
(Mr. Budai, Hungary)
The decision of the Belgrade Government was taken at a time when the
situation in each of the three regions continues to be volatile. The
international community has had well-founded reasons to concentrate its
attention recently on Kosovo, where tension gives cause for serious concern.
However, the situation is also very fragile in Vojvodina and Sandjak, where
the human rights and fundamental freedoms of ethnic communities are far from
being fully respected. We are particularly concerned about the situation of
the Hungarian minority in Vojvodina, which is being continuously threatened
and lives under conditions of intimidation and harassment. As a consequence
of this, tens of thousands of Hungarians have had to leave and seek refuge
abroad, mainly in my country. It is not by accident, either, that at the same
time Serb settlers have been sent to Vojvodina in large numbers, moving into
the homes of Hungarians who left the region. Although the methods are
somewhat different, the objectives behind this scenario are all too familiar
by now.
Hungary, like the CSCE community as a whole, is of the view that the
expulsion of the CSCE missions is an act that further aggravates the threat to
peace and security in the Balkan region. Therefore, we consider that the call
of the Council to the Belgrade Government to re-examine its position is a
perfectly legitimate and sound action, supporting the efforts of the CSCE in
this matter of grave concern.
Mr. SARDENBERG (Brazil): Let me start by congratulating you,
Madam President, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council
for the month of August. I have no doubt that under your intelligent guidance
the Council will successfully discharge its duties in what may turn out to be
yet another very busy month.
S/PV.3262
7
(Mr, Sardenberg, Brazil)
A word of recognition is also due to Ambassador David Hannay and to the
delegation of the United Kingdom for the highly skilled manner in which they
conducted the work of the Council in July.
The Brazilian delegation voted in favour of resolution 855 (1993),
adopted in response to the notification provided by the Chairman-in-Office of
the Council of Ministers of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe (CSCE), under Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations,
regarding the suspension of the CSCE missions in the regions of Kosovo,
Sandjak and Vojvodina of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
It did so bearing in mind that the consideration of the substantive
aspects of this issue, which is to be seen within the framework of the
relationship between the CSCE and its member States, falls within the
competence of that regional arrangement.
Today's resolution, which exhorts the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to
reconsider its position and allow the continuation of the three CSCE long-term
missions in its territory, was adopted by the Security Council at the request
of some of its members that are also members of the CSCE. It is the hope of
my delegation that the decision taken today by the Council will help create
conditions for the adoption of the measures of cooperation called for in the
resolution and ultimately for the solution of the differences between the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the CSCE.
The PRESIDENT: I thank the representative of Brazil for the kind
words he addressed to me.
Mr■ KHAN (Pakistan): I should like first, Madam President,to
welcome your leadership of the Council for the current month and assure you of
my delegation's fullest support and cooperation.
S/PV.3262
8
(Mr. Khan, Pakistan)
On behalf of the Pakistan delegation, I should like to register our
profound gratitude to Sir David Hannay, the Permanent Representative
representative of the United Kingdom, for his sagacious and excellent guidance
of the Council's activities over the difficult month of July.
We are grateful to the co-sponsors of resolution 855 (1993) for taking a
timely initiative to ensure the resumption of the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) missions in Kosovo, Sandjak and Vojvodina. We
deeply regret the decision of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia authorities
to expel these missions. Pakistan recognizes the value of the contribution
that these missions have made to peace and stability in the area. We strongly
share the view that their departure would further aggravate the existing
threat to peace and security in the region.
My delegation deems it appropriate to recall the decision of the
Twenty-first Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers, held in Karachi in April
this year, urging the Security Council to adopt effective measures to prevent
any further aggravation of the extremely tense situation in Kosovo, Sandjak
and Vojvodina.
There are important lessons to be learned from the evolving situation in
the region, which is largely a direct result of the ineffective action of the
international community on the continuing aggression against the Republic of
Bosnia and Herzegovina. if the gains of aggression are allowed to be accepted
in Bosnia and Herzegovina, there is bound to be a spillover of the aggression
and conflict elsewhere in the region. The Security Council must therefore act
with resolve and determination on the basis of the principles of the United
Nations Charter and respect for the rule of law.
S/PV.3262
9
(Mr. Khan, Pakistan)
In the specific case of Kosovo, Sandjak and Vojvodina, the adoption of
the present resolution presents only a first step. We express the hope that
it will lead to an early resumption of CSCE missions in the region.
"The PRESIDENT; I thank the representative of Pakistan for the kind"
words he addressed to me.
Mr. MERIMEE (France) (interpretation from French): The delegation
of France would like to add its congratulations to those that you,
Madam President, extended to the Ambassador of the United Kingdom for the
remarkable way in which he presided over our work during July. I should also
like to say how pleased we are to see you guiding the Council's work this
"month; we know that the Council is in good hands."
My delegation is pleased that the Council is giving its firm support to
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) so that the
activities of its long-term missions in the former Yugoslavia can continue.
Their positive contribution is recognized by all. As stated in letters from
the Chairman-in-Office of the Council of Ministers of the CSCE, it is a
question of ensuring the stability of the region. The decision of the
Belgrade authorities to discontinue the missions is therefore unacceptable.
As the resolution adopted today emphasizes, the activities of the
missions are in no way aimed at affecting the sovereignty of a State, but are
designed to ensure respect for the fundamental principles to which all the
member States of the CSCE, including the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(Serbia and Montenegro) have committed themselves. Their presence contributes
to avoiding any extension of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia to Kosovo,
Sandjak and Vojvodina, where there are real risks.
We are therefore gratified that the Council is making this solemn appeal
to the Yugoslav authorities to reconsider their refusal to allow the
S/PV.3262
10
(Mr, Merimee, France)
continuation of the activities of the CSCE long-term missions on their
territory. It is up to them to do so without setting any conditions and
without introducing irrelevant matters into this issue.
The PRESIDENT: I thank the representative of France for the kind
words he addressed to me.
Mr■ HATANO (Japan): At the outset, let me congratulate you.
Madam President, on your assumption of the presidency of the Council this
month. I also wish to express my appreciation to Ambassador Hannay, who
presided over the Council in an efficient manner during the month of July.
S/PV.3262
11
(Mr. Hatano, Japan)
Japan is gravely concerned over the situation in Kosovo and other areas.
Let us recall the Tokyo Summit Political Declaration, issued by the countries
of the Group of 7 on 8 July 1993, which stated:
"""Deeply concerned about the situation in Kosovo, we call upon the Serbian"
Government to reverse its decision to expel the CSCE monitors from Kosovo
and elsewhere in Serbia and to agree to a significant increase in their
"numbers."""
Despite such appeals by the international community, the situation remains
unchanged.
Japan attaches great importance to the work of the Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Japan holds observer status in the
Conference and has dispatched personnel to its mission to Yugoslavia. The
mission certainly deserves our sincere appreciation. The Serb authorities
have said they understand its importance, but if the necessary action is not
taken the Serb side will be responsible for any escalation of tensions there.
By the same token, any attempt to link acceptance of the mission with
other questions is inappropriate. Monitoring of the area is necessary and is
not a matter for bargaining.
The situation in Kosovo and other areas cannot be allowed to become a
greater threat to the peace and security of the region, and the international
community must therefore address the situation in a timely and effective
manner. Failure to do so would become a source of greater regret. For this
reason, Japan supported the action by the Security Council, and it hopes that
the Serb authorities will respond properly to this clear message.
The PRESIDENT: I thank the representative of Japan for his kind
words addressed to me.
S/PV.3262
12
Mr. PEDAUYE (Spain) (interpretation from Spanish): The Spanish
delegation is pleased. Madam President, to see you at the helm. ■ Your personal
qualities, long-standing commitment to the international scene and lofty
responsibilities in your own country's administration are the best guarantee
of the successful execution of your functions as President of this Council in
August.
Allow me also to pay tribute to the excellent work done by your
predecessor. Ambassador Hannay of the United Kingdom, whose outstanding
qualities and diplomatic telent are well known to all of us.
Since being set up by a decision of the Committee of Senior Officials in
Prague in September 1992, a group of 20 observers, under the command of
Ambassador Bogh of Norway, has been carrying out important work to promote
dialogue and cooperation between the minority groups in the regions of Kosovo,
Sandjak and Vojvodina of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the competent
authorities of that country. Their work, carried out with dedication and
scrupulous impartiality, has served the cause of peace, as has been recognized
by the authorities of Serb..a and Montenegro. Evidence of this is the letter
dated 3 August from the representative of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
addressed to the Secretary-General. Distributed as an official Security
Council document (S/26234), this letter says:
"""As far as the Missions of Long Duration are concerned, we are fully"
aware of the positive results of the Missions' presence in the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia and we have nothing against their renewed presence
"in future,"". (S/26234, p.2)"
It then adds this:
S/PV.3262
13
(Mr. Pedauve, Spain)
"""but it is for CSCE to decide when it would be prepared to accept our"
"offer for normal cooperation with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."""
(ibid., pp. 2-3)
As regards this second point - the wish of the authorities of Serbia and
Montenegro to have its status in the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe (CSCE) reviewed - my delegation considers that it is not a matter on
which the Security Council should make any pronouncement. We hold this view
for various reasons - in particular, that the Conference itself has expressed
its interest in seeing this situation normalized as soon as possible. Thus,
at its meeting in Stockholm late last year.
Foreign Affairs of the countries members of
conditions that must be met for the Federal
the Council of Ministers for
the CSCE defined the essential
Republic of Yugoslavia to be
gradually readmitted to the Conference. We
adhere
to those conditions
The Spanish authorities regret the refusal
of
the authorities in Belgrade
to authorize the CSCE missions of long duration
in
Kosovo, Sandjak and
Vojvodina to continue their activities, because
we
are firmly convinced that
the work of those missions is fundamental to the maintenance of peace and
stability in the region because it prevents both possible outbreaks of
violence and an increase in the instability prevailing in the area.
Hence, we hope that the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
will reconsider the decision they have taken on this matter.
For all those reasons, the Spanish delegation cosponsored the draft
resolution that was before the Council today and voted in favour of its
adoption.
The PRESIDENT: I thank the representative of Spain for his kind
words addressed to me.
S/PV.3262
14
Mr. RICHARDSON (United Kingdom): Let me first say. Madam President,
how delighted we are to see you in the Chair in this month of August. We hope
you have a successful time and we offer you our full cooperation.
It is a matter of great concern to my delegation that the authorities in
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have refused to allow the missions of the
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) to continue their work
in Kosovo, Sandjak and Vojvodina. I must remind the authorities in Belgrade
that they continue to be bound by obligations which were entered into in the
context of the CSCE and the binding commitments under the so-called Moscow
mechanisms. I also note, as others have done before me, that the authorities
in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have themselves acknowledged, in
document S/26234, the positive results of CSCE missions. They are a source of
objective information, they promote security and dialogue between the
communities there and above all, we hope, they will avoid any spread of the
already-terrible conflict to other parts of ex-Yugoslavia.
We regret very much that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has not yet
lived up to its obligations. We hope it will now do so without delay, and we
associate ourselves with remarks made earlier, in particular by the Japanese
and Spanish delegations, that this is not a matte.' for bargaining between the
CSCE and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
The PRESIDENT: I thank the representative of the United Kingdom for
his kind words addressed to me.
Mr. OLHAYE (Djibouti): I wish to express. Madam President, our
warmest congratulations on your assumption of the presidency of the Council
for this month. Indeed, your wisdom, candour and affability are the kind of
personal qualities that will no doubt enhance the effectiveness of this
Council.
S/PV.3262
15
(Mr. Olhave, Djibouti)
May I also express our deep gratitude to Ambassador David Hannay of the
United Kingdom for the exemplary manner in which he guided the work of the
Council last month.
Confronted so often as we are in the Council with man-made disasters, we
perhaps tend to overlook those phenomena of nature which periodically seem to
remind mankind of the existence of powers beyond our own. We have been
witnessing for some time now the awesome spectacle of rampaging rivers in the
American Midwest, which has unleashed widespread destruction and suffering
among the people of the area. Such has been the tragedy there that the
drought a short distance to the south has scarcely been noticed. May we offer
your delegation. Madam President, our deepest sympathies and heartfelt wishes
for that region's speedy recovery and return to normalcy.
S/PV.3262
16
(Mr, Olhave, Djibouti)
My delegation lends its full support to the draft resolution just voted
upon, on the need to retain monitors of the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in Kosovo, Vojvodina and Sandjak. Once again we
are faced with a situation pregnant with the possibility, indeed almost the
certainty, of the outbreak of hostilities, as a result of pervasive repression
of the Albanian ethnic group, numbering more than 2 million and constituting
the majority of the population of Kosovo. All the signs of a military
offensive are there, such as the increase of troops in the area, intentional
and provocative troop movements, and low flights of military aircraft. There
is the unmistakable indication of a repeat of the Bosnian tragedy. Given the
pervasive ethnic ties in the Balkan area, which never seem to follow national
boundaries or borders, containment of these hostilities will present an
impossible task. We may be faced, therefore, with a general Balkan conflict.
Fear of such a widespread conflict has been the focus of the desire for
monitors in the area, to watch for any signs of a heightening of tensions.
There is perhaps, though, a more immediately humanitarian aspect to this
situation, which needs to be addressed as well. That is the total abuse of
the human rights of the non-Serb people in the area, part of the pattern of
"""ethnic cleansing"" we have seen often in Bosnia."
Non-Serbs in Kosovo have systematically been denied property, removed
from their homes, excluded from employment, had their schools closed, faced
religious persecution, been subjected to physical abuse, and had many of their
organizations prevented from operating. Torture, disappearances, arbitrary
detention, killing and political imprisonment are widespread and increasing.
These facts are well known, and every day appear to worsen. Naturally,
however, they are disputed by the Serbs, who continually offer us a different
"""spin"" to events there. Undoubtedly things will only become worse if the"
S/PV.3262
17
(Mr. Olhave, Djibouti)
"Serbs are allowed to continue unmonitored; and the true nature of the abuses,"
not to speak of their extent, will be hidden from public view. Certainly the
Serbs recognize this, which is why they have seized the opportunity to blame
the CSCE for an unwillingness to cooperate with them, using this as
justification for terminating the mandate of the monitors.
Belgrade recognizes only too well what is implicit in this dispute - we
"are really talking about Bcsnia; the case really lies in the siege of Sarajevo"
and other towns in Bosnia. As long as this genocide is allowed to continue,
Belgrade has no reason to blink first. The international community has
blinked so often in Bosnia - and continues to blink - that our eyes are now
nearly always closed.
Nevertheless, for what it may achieve, my delegation therefore supported
the resolution for the return of the monitors. In this way, we shall at least
have available reports to corroborate our worst fears.
"The PRESIDENT; I thank the representative of Djibouti for his kind"
words addressed to me, and in my national capacity I should like to thank him
for his good words about the problems of the people in the United States.
I should now like to make a statement in my capacity as the
representative of the United States.
The United States strongly supports the activities of the missions of
long duration of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)
as vital to the international community's efforts to prevent the spread of the
conflict in the former Yugoslavia. By monitoring the human rights situation
in Kosovo, Sandjak and Vojvodina, these missions have announced clearly to the
authorities in Belgrade that the international community will not tolerate
Serbian oppression of local non-Serb populations.
S/PV.3262
18
(The President)
The United States Government has made this same point. President Bush's
message was specific and clear: We are prepared to respond against Serbia in
the event of a conflict in Kosovo caused by Serbian action. Secretary of
State Christopher has firmly reiterated this message.
The decision of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to terminate the CSCE
missions was a serious mistake, and we call on the authorities to reinstate
them at once, without any precondition. It is evident that the authorities in
Belgrade would like to trade their permission to reinstate the CSCE missions
for the Federal Republic's return to membership in the CSCE.
The CSCE has made it uneguivocally clear that these missions are not part
of any bargain. We fully support that position. The authorities in Belgrade
should understand that all parties to the tragedy that has engulfed the former
Yugoslavia can only gain by the presence of impartial human rights observers.
Human rights abuses will simply delay Serbia and Montenegro's return to the
community of nations. Broader conflict born of human rights abuses will wound
the aggressor along with the victim.
I now resume my function as President of the Council.
There are no further speakers. The Security Council has thus concluded
the present stage of its consideration of the item on its agenda.
The meeting rose at 5.25 p.m.
