ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
The agenda was adopted.
THE SITUATION PREVAILING IN AND ADJACENT TO THE UNITED NATIONS PROTECTED AREAS
IN CROATIA
LETTER DATED 14 JULY 1993 FROM THE SECRETARY-GENERAL ADDRESSED TO THE
PRESIDENT OF THE SECURITY COUNCIL (S/26082)
The PRESIDENT: The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on the agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them document S/26082, which contains
the text of a letter dated 14 July 1993 from the Secretary-General addressed
to the President of the Security Council.
I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to
document S/26074, which contains the text of a letter dated 12 July 1993 from
the Permanent Representative of Croatia to the United Nations addressed to the
President of the Security Council.
Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have
been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:
"""The Security Council is deeply concerned at the information"
contained in the letter of the Secretary-General of 14 July 1993
(S/26082) on the situation in and around the United Nations Protected
Areas (UNPAs) in the Republic of Croatia. It recalls its resolutions
802 (1993) and 847 (1993) and in particular the demand in the former that
all parties and others concerned comply strictly with the cease-fire
arrangements already agreed and the call on them in the latter to reach
an agreement on confidence-building measures.

(The President)
"""The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the latest"
report on hostilities in the UNPAs, including in particular by the
Krajina Serbs, and demands that these hostilities cease immediately.
"""The Security Council continues to attach the highest importance to"
securing the reopening of the Maslenica crossing to civilian traffic. In
this context it reaffirms its support for the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of the Republic of Croatia. It recognizes the real and
legitimate concern of the Government of the Republic of Croatia in such
reopening, as set out in the letter of 12 July 1993 from the Permanent
Representative of the Republic of Croatia (S/26074). It also recalls the
demand in its resolution 802 (1993) that the Croatian armed forces
withdraw from the areas in question.
"""The Security Council considers that the planned unilateral"
reopening of the Maslenica bridge and of Zemunik Airport on 18 July 1993,
in the absence of agreement between the parties and others concerned in
cooperation with the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), would
jeopardize the objectives of the Council's resolutions and in particular
the call in its resolution 847 (1993) for agreement on
confidence-building measures and the efforts of the Co-Chairmen of the
International
a negotiated settlement to the problem.

(The President)
agreement on confidence-building measures called for in its resolution
847 (1993). It joins the Secretary-General in his call to the parties
and others concerned to act in a manner conducive to the maintenance of
peace and to refrain from any action which would undermine these efforts,
and calls upon the parties to assure UNPROFOR's freedom of access in
"particular to the area surrounding the Maslenica crossing."""
This statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council under
the symbol S/26084.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on the agenda.
The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.
