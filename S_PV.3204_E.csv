ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
The agenda was adopted.
PARTICIPATION OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA (SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO) IN
THE WORK OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL
"The PRESIDENT; The Security Council will now begin its"
consideration of the item on its agenda. The Council is meeting in accordance
with the understanding reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them document S/25675, which contains
the text of a draft resolution submitted by France, Spain and the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
I should like to draw the attention of members of the Council to the
following revision to be made to the text of the draft resolution contained in
document S/25675, in its provisional form. The following preambular paragraph
should be inserted after the first preambular paragraph:
"""Considering that the State formerly known as the Socialist Federal"
"Republic of Yugoslavia has ceased to exist,""."
The United States of America has joined as a sponsor of the draft
resolution.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to vote on
the draft resolution before it. Unless I hear any objection, I shall now put
the draft resolution (S/25675), as orally revised in its provisional form, to
the vote.
There being no objection, it is so decided.

The PRESIDENT: The result of the voting is as follows: 13 in
favour, none against and 2 abstentions. The draft resolution, as orally
revised in its provisional form, has been adopted as resolution 821 (1993)
I shall now call on those members of the Council who wish to make
statements following the voting.
Mr, CHEN Ji an (China) (interpretation from Chinese): The Chinese
delegation abstained in the vote on the resolution just adopted by the
Security Council. When the Security Council adopted resolution 777 (1992),
the Chinese delegation expressed its principled position with regard to the
question of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

(Mr, Chen Jian, China)
We have always held that all the Republics of former Yugoslavia should
take their own seats in the United Nations and other organs of the system, and
no Republic should be excluded lightly.
We are of the opinion that the resolution just adopted is a transitory
arrangement. We hope that the question of the seat of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia can be settled properly, that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
can obtain its own seat in the United Nations and the organs belonging to the
United Nations system.
Ms, ALBRIGHT (United States of America): The United States
cosponsored and voted in favour of this resolution, as we continue to believe
that the claim of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to membership in
international organizations is legally invalid.
We look forward to the day when the United States could support the
application of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for admission to the United
Nations. Unfortunately, that day appears far away. Just yesterday the
Bosnian Serbs launched new attacks on Bosnian Government positions near
Bihac. Gross violations of human rights continue. In fact, it appears that
the Serbs are making a special effort to flaunt the will of the international
community.
The Belgrade authorities must end their support for the Bosnian Serbs.
They must end their support for aggression in Bosnia and Croatia.
The international community and the Security Council have gone on record
as demanding that the Bosnian Serbs sign and implement the peace plan which
the two other parties have indeed signed. Until that day, they will remain
international pariahs.

(Ms, Albright, United
States)
The United States will support the application of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia for membership in this Organization when - and only when - Serbia
and Montenegro meet the criteria in the United Nations Charter, that is, the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia must show that it is a peace-loving State and
demonstrate its willingness to comply fully with Chapter VII resolutions of
the Security Council.
Mr, SARDENBERG (Brazil): Although not a member of the Security
Council at the time of the adoption of resolution 777 (1992), related to the
participation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the work of the General
Assembly, Brazil had the opportunity to express its views on the issue when it
was taken up by the General Assembly last September. On that occasion, Brazil
abstained in the voting on Assembly resolution 47/1.
We remain convinced now, as we were then, that questions related to
admission, participation, suspension or expulsion affect the most basic rights
of States in relation to the Organization and should therefore be dealt with
with the utmost care and attention, bearing in mind the fundamental need to
follow the Charter strictly.
Having said that, we note that over the past seven months the situation
in the area has not ceased derioriating, particularly in Bosnia and
"Herzegovina; indeed, it has degenerated into an utterly dreadful display of"
inhumanity.
It is only such extraordinary circumstances that can justify measures of
an extraordinary nature. By voting in favour of resolution 821(1993), Brazil
wishes to signify its support for the urgent efforts of the Security Council
aimed at bringing to an end the cruel conflict in the territory of the former
Yugolsavia.

(Mr, Sardenberq, Brazil)
We hope that conditions may soon exist to review the decision taken
today. It is indeed our hope that the message implied in the adoption of this
resolution will be carefully considered by those concerned and will prove
helful in the achievement of the objective we all share: restoring peace in
that region, and making it a lasting peace.
Mr. LOZINSKIY (Russian Federation)(interpretation from Russian): The
delegation of the Russian Federation abstained in the voting on the resolution
just adopted, since we are against any further steps - in addition to the
ones already taken within the United Nations system last autumn - to separate
Belgrade and keep it outside international organizations.
Recent events in the Yugoslav crisis, in which all parties are involved,
and the fact that the leadership of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has
undertaken specific steps to apply pressure on the Bosnian Serbs in order to
ensure that they adhere to the Vance-Owen plan, make the idea of meting out
further punishment to Belgrade inappropriate, in our view. The impression may
be given that the international community regards such punishment as an end in
itself, to the detriment of ongoing efforts to seek a peaceful settlement,
which requires a well-balanced and well-thought-out approach.
The PRESIDENT: There are no further names on the list of speakers.
The Security Council has just concluded the present stage of its consideration
of the item on its agenda.
The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.
