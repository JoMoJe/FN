ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
The agenda was adopted.
THE SITUATION IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
"The PRESIDENT; The Security Council will now begin its"
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in the course of its prior consultations.
Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have
been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council.
"""The Security Council has been informed by the Secretary-General in"
a letter of 12 March 1993 of the violation on 11 March 1993 by military
jets, proceeding from the airport of Banja Luka, of Security Council
resolution 781 (1992), relating to the prohibition of military flights in
the airspace of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, notwithstanding
the fact that the Bosnian Serbs at the airport had received appropriate
notification by United Nations observers that such flights would
constitute a violation of the said resolution.
"""The Security Council equally takes note of the report by the"
Secretary-General in his letter of 16 March 1993 indicating that on
13 March 1993 new violations of the no-fly zone took place by planes that
proceeded to bomb the villages of Gladovici and Osatica in the Republic
of Bosnia and Herzegovina before leaving in the direction of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). The above flights are
the first violations of Security Council resolution 781 (1992), observed
by UNPROFOR which involved combat activity.

(The President)
"""The Security Council strongly condemns all violations of its"
relevant resolutions and underlines the fact that since the beginning of
the monitoring operations in early November 1992, the United Nations has
reported 465 violations of the no-fly zone over the Republic of Bosnia
and Herzegovina.
"""The Security Council demands that these violations cease forthwith"
and reiterates its strong determination to ensure full respect of its
resolutions. It particularly underlines its condemnation of all
violations, especially those reported by the Secretary-General in his
letters referred to above, at a time when the peace process has reached a
critical juncture and when humanitarian relief efforts require full
cooperation by all parties.
"""The Security Council demands from the Bosnian Serbs an immediate"
explanation of the aforementioned violations and particularly of the
aerial bombardment of the villages of Gladovici and Osatica.
"""It requests the Secretary-General to ensure that an investigation"
is made of the reported possible use of the territory of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to launch air attacks
against the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
"""The Security Council has mandated its President to convey to the"
Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
(Serbia and Montenegro) and to the leader of the Bosnian Serbs its
deepest concern about the above-mentioned developments, and its demand
that they take immediate action to prevent any repetitions of these
attacks.

(The President)
"""The Security Council will continue to consider what additional"
steps may be required to secure implementation of the provisions of
"relevant Security Council resolutions."""
The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its
consideration of the item on the agenda. The Security Council will remain
seized of the matter.
