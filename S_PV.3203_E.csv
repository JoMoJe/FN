The PRESIDENT: The Security Council will now resume its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The first speaker is the representative of Jordan. I invite him to take
a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr, ABU ODEH (Jordan) (interpretation from Arabic): Permit me to
begin the statement of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan by congratulating you,
Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Council for this month. I am
confident that your wide experience, expertise and wisdom will enable you to
conduct the business of the Council in the best manner.
I take this opportunity also to express the gratitude and appreciation of
my country's delegation to Ambassador O'Brien, Permanent Representative of New
Zealand, for the successful, dextrous and able way in which he guided the work
of the Council last month.
Let me also thank you, Mr. President, for convening this series of
meetings to discuss the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. But before going
into the escalating tragic aspects of the situation of that unfortunate
country and the urgent tasks it imposes upon the Council, it is my duty first
to point to the bright sidp, faint as it is, of this grim picture. On behalf
of my delegation I should like to pay a tribute to the efforts of the
international peace-keeping forces for the humanitarian task they are carrying
out in very difficult conditions. I also pay a tribute to the
non-governmental relief organizations for their commendable persistence in
providing assistance to the afflicted in this crazy and ugly war.
I do not intend to review all the chapters of the tragi-comedy entitled
"Bosnia and Herzegovina; it has been and continues to be watched in every"
household that owns a television set anywhere in the world. It is all well
known to the Council, because the details are repeated day after day in every
S/PV.3203
4
(Mr, Abu Odeh, Jordan)
phase of the development of the Serb aggression against Bosnian Muslims that
has been going on for over a year.
Suffice it to say that the Serb aggression constitutes an open and
continuous challenge to the Charter of the United Rations and that it is
aggression being carried out by criminals who continue to deny not only the
humanity of their victims but their own humanity as well. All the resolutions
adopted against them and all the appeals made to their humanity have failed to
deter them or to halt their brutality. Is he a human being who robs tens of
thousands of children of their future and who continues to do so? Is he a
human being who systematically and collectively rapes women and who continues
to do so? Is he a human being who uproots others from their homes and
livelihoods and from the habitat in which they grew up and who continues to do
"so? Is he a human being of our modern age who practises the crime of ""ethnic"
"cleansing"" and who continues to do so?"
It is no less painful, sad and shocking that these acts are being
committed in the heart of Europe by a European people. Where are the human
rights, ideals and principles that are the adornments of Western discourse?
Where, indeed, is the United Nations?
If the Serbs challenge and violate the Charter of the United Nations by
continuing their aggression against Muslims, the United Nations would be
violating the Charter if it failed to use the powers provided for in the
Charter to stop that aggression - unless there are two United Nations, one
that uses its powers and another that does not.
If that is the case, what is going to happen to international peace and
security? We are confused. Are we to expect aggression to be deterred or
stopped only if the conflict occurs in a country where the influential Powers
have interests? Is that to be the standard? Then so be it.
S/PV.,3203
5
, (Mr, Abu Odeh, Jordan)
Nevertheless, we have to ask ourselves, what about human rights?
Do members not agree with me that the failure of the United Nations after
I
a year of continuous Serb aggression against Bosnian Muslims to deter or stop
that aggression places every Member State in front of a mirror containing, if
not the picture of Dorian Gray, then at least that of hypocrisy beyond its
politically accepted limits?
Would I be exaggerating to propose that, in order to alleviate the
ugliness of that picture and in order for us in the United Nations to be true
to ourselves, the international conference on human rights to be held at
Vienna be postponed and that debate on human rights in any country be
suspended until we are able to preserve the human dignity of the Bosnian
Muslim survivors?
S/PV.3203
6
(Mr, Abu Odeh, Jordan)
I should like to make it clear that I am saying this without ulterior
motives, because my country is proud of its respect for human rights.
It would not be difficult for an observer tracking the Serbian aggression
to realize that this aggression has followed a certain pattern since it
started over a year ago. The pattern is as follows: first, a brutal Serbian
"attack on Muslims; secondly, a resolution adopted by the Security Council;"
thirdly, a cease-fire agreement between the Serbs and the Muslims, arranged by
"the United Nations command in the field; fourthly, a Serbian violation of the"
"cease-fire in the form of a new attack; fifthly, new gains on the ground by"
the Serbian forces.
The situation has reached a stage which makes it imperative for us to be
more candid so that we may learn the lessons of this experience and reach a
decisive solution that would put an end to the aggression and enable the
conflicting parties to reach a peaceful solution to the problem and would
break the pattern the Serbian aggression has followed.
In this context, I should like to point out two things. First, it is .
well known that resort to Article 42 of the Charter cannot take place without
the agreement of the great Powers, for many realistic reasons, chief among
which is that the application of this Article has military and logistical
requirements that are feasible only for the great Powers. We all know that
the leaders of these Powers have, on several occasions, said that it is
difficult to take military action to stop the Serbian aggression and that it
should therefore be avoided, citing in this regard the situation faced by the
German divisions fighting in Yugoslav territory during the Second World War.
I am certain that such statements were not meant to reassure the Serbian
S/PV.3203
7
(Mr, Abu Odeh, Jordan)
leaders, but, unfortunately, they conveyed an implicit message that gave them
assurance that Article 42 would not be applied against them.
Secondly, the Security Council resolution that banned shipments of
armaments to the conflicting parties has created a strange and sad situation.
The image of the situation that emerges from this resolution is that of a
Bosnian Muslim tied to a tree from head to toe and a Serbian tied to a tree by
his leg with a long rope and still holding his whip in his hand. The Serbian
has been whipping the Muslim, who can only scream for help. The onlookers,
represented by the United Nations, only offer him water so that he may not die
of thirst.
Resolution 820 (1993) was necessary. My country's delegation, however,
fears that the impact of this resolution will be no better than that of its
predecessors, in that it will not stop the Serbian aggression until the Serbs
have achieved all their objectives on the ground. So, according to the
pattern followed by the Serbs, the next step would be a cease-fire agreement,
followed by a Serbian violation in the form of a new attack and the
achievement of new gains.
For resolution 820 (1993) to bear its intended fruits, my delegation
proposes that the Council adopt a new resolution supporting resolution 820
(1993) and giving it force and effectiveness by including two things. First,
it should lift the ban on arming the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in
accordance with Article 51 of the Charter. To say that arming the Bosnian
Muslims would increase the killing is not a sound argument to justify the
Security Council's reluctance to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnian
Muslims. Since the beginning of the Serbian aggression the Muslims have been
in a position of self-defence, and they are the ones who continue to pay the
,S/PV.,3203
8
(Mr, Abu Odeh, Jordan)
price of the fighting. If they defended themselves they would reduce their
losses. If Serbian losses were increased, that would not be objectionable,
"because the losses would, hopefully, deter them, and this is the intention;"
for what is required, in the first place, is to stop the fighting so that
peace negotiations may continue, especially since the Muslims and the Croats
have already signed the Vance-Owen plan.
Secondly, a final warning should be issued to the Serbian forces that
"they should initiate a cease-fire on a certain date; otherwise, the Security"
Council would apply Article 42 of the Charter.
My delegation supports all the efforts undertaken to achieve a cease-fire
as a preliminary step towards achieving a peaceful solution to this war, which
has degraded human dignity and shaken the credibility of the United Nations.
"The PRESIDENT; I thank the representative of Jordan for his kind"
words addressed to my predecessor and to me.
The next speaker is the representative of Lithuania. I invite him to
take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr, SIMUTIS (Lithuania): Allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your
asumption of the presidency of the Security Council this month. I wish you
the greatest success as you preside over deliberations on extremely difficult
and important issues. I also pay a tribute to the President of the Council
for the month of March, Ambassador O'Brien of New Zealand, for his able
guidance of the Council's work. Please allow me also to express my
appreciation for this opportunity to address the Security Council, which is
entrusted with the main tas.x of the United Nations: maintaining peace and
security in our turbulent world.
S/PV.3203
9-10	'
(Mr, Simutis, Lithuania)
I wish to convey to the Security Council the great concern of the
Government and the people of Lithuania over the tragic situation in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. The Lithuanian people are horrified at such blatant violations
of international humanitarian law as the intense shelling of Bosnian cities
and towns, unending massacres, rapes and expulsions of the civilian population
"under the outrageous policy of ""ethnic cleansing"". This horror has continued"
for over a year now, and it appears that previously undertaken measures to
stop it are failing.
S/PV.3203
11
(Mr, Simutis, Lithuania)
As a small State, Lithuania to a large extent relies for its security on
the United Nations, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and
other international organizations. We are convinced that the credibility of
these organizations in preventing conflicts and managing crises will depend on
their ability to act with resolve and determination in the Bosnian crisis.
Still, countless cease-fires have been broken in a matter of days or hours,
and the decisions of the Security Council are blatantly disregarded. The
"question arises of whether the policies of aggression and ""ethnic cleansing"""
will be allowed to succeed. If this is the case, how can a small country rely
in the future on international organizations and the concept of collective
security?
We should be aware of the grave implications the Bosnian tragedy poses
for the international community. The greatest danger lies in the
incompatibility between the emerging prospects for collective security and the
failure of international organizations to stop the aggression. The violent
and forcible subjugation of a sovereign State Member of the United Nations, if
allowed to succeed, will set an ominous precedent for the future. It is the
duty of the nations around this table and the United Nations membership as a
whole to ensure that the resurgence of the policy of might makes right does
not prevail.
The PRESIDENT: I thank the representative of Lithuania for his kind
words addressed to my predecessor and to me.
The next speaker is the representative of Algeria. I invite him to take
a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
S/PV.3203
12
Mr, HADID (Algeria) (interpretation from French)! Allow me first of
all to extend to you, Sir, the warm congratulations of the Algerian delegation
on your assuming the presidency of the Council for the month of April. The
effectiveness and skill you are displaying in guiding the work of the Council
bear witness to your great talents, which are recognized by all, and are
guarantees of success in your mission.
Your predecessor as President of the Council, Ambassador O’Brien of
New Zealand, is likewise fully deserving of our gratitude and consideration
for the noteworthy way in which he performed his duties last month.
The current discussion is being held at a time when the tragedy that is
being visited on the Bosnian people, and more specifically on the Muslim
population of that country, has crossed a new threshold fraught with
consequences. The events in eastern Bosnia confirm - if such were necessary -
that there is an escalation going on that is dangerous for the future not only
of Bosnia and Herzegovina but also of the entire Balkan region. This
escalation reflects the aggressor's persistance in his attitude of defiance
towards the international community.
The plight of the civilian populations has been accurately described as
attempted genocide, as has just been confirmed as such by the International
Court of Justice in its opinion handed down on 8 April, in which it called for
respect for the commitments that have been made in the area of prevention and
punishment of the crime of genocide.
Algeria, which over a year ago drew the attention of the Council to the
seriousness of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to the risks of
escalation inherent in it, wishes to reiterate its solidarity with and its
support for the Bosnian Government in defending the sovereignty, territorial
' S/PV.3203
13
(Mr, Hadid, Algeria)
integrity and independence of that State Member of the United Nations.
Furthermore, we would emphasize that it is up to the international community,
and more specifically the Security Council, to ensure respect for the
principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations by sparing no
effort to put an end to the aggression and re-establish justice and the rule
of law.
That is why Algeria has constantly endeavoured, both in the Organization
of the Islamic Conference and in the non-aligned Movement, to encourage
political pressure and specific measures to implement a just and lasting
settlement of this problem. We have also contributed to the humanitarian
efforts by supplying material assistance and by receiving and treating the
wounded.
The Vance-Owen plan, into whose drafting so much effort was put, has been
accepted by the Bosnian Government and by the Croat side despite its
"shortcomings; this demonstration of flexibility and the sense of compromise"
has, unfortunately, failed to elicit a similar attitude on the part of the
Serbian side, which has not only rejected the plan but also stepped up its
acts of aggression with a view to achieving yet more territorial gains and to
"continuing its pursuit of the unspeakable practice of ""ethnic cleansing""."
It is quite obvious that things cannot be allowed to go on as they are.
It is also clear that the measures taken so far by the Security Council have
had only a limited effect. Thus, the time has come for the Council fully to
discharge its responsibilities vis-a-vis this tragedy that is troubling the
conscience of the whole world.
This presupposes, firstly, the immediate cessation of hostilities
throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina and the urgent establishment of safe areas
to avoid the recurrence and spread of tragedies like the one that occurred in
S/PV.3203
14-15
(Mr, Hadid/ Algeria)
Srebrenica. Secondly, it is necessary for us to consider expanding the
mandate and composition of the United Nations Protection Force so that it can
effectively carry out its mission to protect the civilian propulations that
"are being subjected to all kinds of outrages and to the practice of ""ethnic"
"cleansing""."
The time has also come for the Security Council to take every step
possible to establish, as a matter of urgency, control over heavy weapons
throughout the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and also to monitor all
supply lines. We believe that these jobs should of course be carried out by
the United Nations.
In the humanitarian field, it is imperative to ensure free access by the
aid convoys as well as to put an end to the forced displacement of populations
and to ensure that displaced persons can return home in complete safety.
In the final analysis, the inadequate responses of the international
community, which have failed to put an end to the aggression and the outrages
suffered by the Bosnian people, and the continued deterioration in the
situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina underline the fact that the arms embargo
imposed on that Republic is an anachronism and in practice looks very like the
negation of its natural right to self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of
the Charter of the United Nations.
The Muslim people of Bosnia, which is with courage and dignity facing up
to intolerable savagery, is more than ever entitled to call for reparation
before the court of history and to demand the means they need to ensure that
it can defend itself.
S/PV.3203
16
(Mr, Hadid, Algeria)
The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is undeniably a challenge to the
credibility of the United Nations - and most particularly this Council. This
multidimensional tragedy - which, in addition, may well become the epicentre
of a major conflagration that could envelop the entire region, generating
unforeseeable consequences - is a test of the capacity of the Security Council
to rise effectively to such a challenge by responding to the demands inherent
in a crisis the facts of which have been so clearly established. It is our
hope that the present debate will contribute to injecting fresh energy into
the Security Council so that it may respond to the expectations of the
international community as well as of world public opinion, which are watching
with indignation the distressing events in the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, whose intensity is increasing each day.
The PRESIDENT: I thank the representative of Algeria for the kind
words he addressed to my predecessor and to me.
The next speaker is the representative of Saudi Arabia. I invite him to
take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr. ALLAGANY (Saudi Arabia) (interpretation from Arabic): At the
outset, I should like to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the
presidency of the Security Council for this month. We are confident that you
will conduct the Council's business with your well-known knowledge and
expertise.
I wish also to thank Ambassador Terence Christopher O'Brien for the
effective way in which he conducted the Security Council's business during his
presidency last month.
My Government took the initiative, along with the other members of the
Contact Group of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, of requesting
S/PV.3203
17
(Mr, Allagany, Saudi Arabia)
the convening of the Security Council to discuss the situation in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. The world has been witnessing with horror the continuation of
Serbian aggression against Bosnia and Herzegovina. But it appears that the
international community has not fully understood the implications that the
barbaric acts committed by the Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina against
civilians and other innocent persons could have for the future.
"The policy of ""ethnic cleansing"" practised by the Serbian leaders has"
"gone as far as the practices of what the Nazis called the ""final solution""."
The destruction of cities, the slaughter of civilians, the intimidation of
children, the rape of women and children, the killing of old people: all
"these are not acts of military courage; rather, they demonstrate a degree of"
barbarism and a set of moral values that will establish another record in the
history of mankind. From the pictures we see of the Serbian practices in
Bosnia and Herzegovina and from the reports of the group of experts that was
sent by the European Community to investigate the rape of Muslim women, we
learn that hundreds of thousands of Muslim women have been raped as part of a
"delilberate and continuing policy designed to achieve ""ethnic cleansing"". The"
rapists have killed a large number of Muslim women, including many who were
actually only children. Furthermore, Serbian paramilitary units continue to
destroy mosques and other religious and cultural places with a view to
exterminating the cultural features of the Islamic cities in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. They are also preventing the delivery of United Nations
humanitarian assistance to the civilians.
It has been clear from the very outset that Serbia and Montenegro has
supported the Serbs, causing great material and human loss to the people of
the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and to their heritage. A few days ago,
S/PV.3203
18
(Mr, Allaganv, Saudi Arabia)
the Security Council adopted two major resolutions - 819 (1993) and
820 (1993). The declaration of Srebenica and its surroundings as safe areas
is an important step towards preventing that city’s fall to the Serbian
forces. The withdrawal of Serbian paramilitary units from Srebenica and its
surroundings should be guaranteed. So should the provision of foodstuffs and
medical assistance to the civilians there.
More than three weeks have passed since the Bosnian Muslim party and the
Croatian party signed the peace agreement known as the Vance-Owen peace plan.
A few days ago, the Security Council adopted resolution 820 (1993), which gave
the Serbs nine days to sign the peace plan, and provided that if they did not
do so, strengthened sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro would come into
effect. The Security Council has once again acknowledged that the
intransigence of the leadership of Serbia and Montenegro is the main obstacle
to the implementation of the peace agreement. We believe that were it not for
the military assistance, including manpower, given by Serbia and Montenegro,
the Serbs in Bosnia would have signed the Vance-Owen plan, thereby enabling it
to be implemented. We are therefore convinced that resolution 820 (1993) will
be effective against Serbia and Montenegro. The complete economic, financial
and commercial isolation of Serbia and Montenegro from the rest of the world
may convince the Serbian leaders to come to their senses. They are confusing
myth with history. They believe that they are invincible, that no one can
touch them. Thus, in our opinion, resolution 820 (1993) was adopted in order
to bring more pressure to bear so that peace could be achieved.
It should be noted that if the Security Council does not act to impose
effective, realistic international control over shipments of heavy weapons,
which are possessed only by the Serbs, not much can be achieved through
S/PV.3203
19-20
(Mr, Allagany. Saudi Arabia)
economic sanctions. It would take a long time for economic sanctions to come
into effect. Time is of the essence for the innocent civilians in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. The Security Council must take inmmediate measures to lift the
arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to enable the Muslims
there to exercise their right to self-defence.
S/PV.3203
21
(Mr. Allagany, Saudi Arabia)
The Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia calls upon the
international community to guarantee the withdrawal of the regular and
irregular Serbian forces from the territory of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina and to help the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina in every way
possible to exercise its right to self-defence. That assistance, whether
material, military or moral, is well deserved. We demand that the
perpetrators of serious violations of the Fourth Geneva Convention be brought
to trial in accordance with the principles and provisions of international
law. We also support the people and Government of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina and demand that Serbia and Montenegro pay them adequate and fair
compensation for their human and material losses. We hope that the
international community will prepare the foundations of a just peace based on
legitimacy in accordance with our Islamic religion.
The PRESIDENT: I thank the representative of Saudi Arabia for his
kind words addressed to my predecessor and to me.
The next speaker is the representative of Malta., I invite him to take a
place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr, CAMILLERI (Malta): My delegation welcomes this opportunity to
address the Security Council on the tragic events in the region of the former
Yugoslavia and especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We have every confidence
that under your able leadership, Mr. President, the Council will find the
necessary courage and wisdom to fulfil the heavy duties that lie before it.
On this occasion, my delegation also wishes to recall the impressive manner in
which the Council's work was managed under your predecessor.
Ambassador Terence O'Brien.
S/PV.3203
22
(Mr, Camilleri, Malta)
The events of the past few days around the Bosnian city of Srebrenica
have sharply crystallized the moral and political dilemma which the
international community has been facing for several months in the former
Yugoslavia, a dilemma which arises from the contrast between the immense
diplomatic and humanitarian effort being expended and the limited returns
being achieved.
As individuals we experience a sense of profound anger and outrage at the
continuing suffering and humiliation being inflicted on fellow human beings.
As Governments we share a deep concern at the direct challenge to
international legality and stability being posed by the cynical disdain with
which the most deeply entrenched norms of humanitarian law continue to be
flouted. In common with others, the Government of Malta firmly and
unequivocally condemns the atrocities which have been committed and continue
to be committed in the former Yugoslavia. We denounce the abhorrent policy of
"""ethnic cleansing"". We demand that the acts of agression against defenceless"
civilians be terminated. We are determined to see that the gross and
systematic violations of human rights do not go unpunished.
For over 12 months, the international community has steadfastly and
consistently applied its most strenuous diplomatic and humanitarian efforts to
bring about a peaceful settlement to the problems of the former Yugoslavia.
In the process, the United Nations has put into place its largest
peace-keeping operation ever. The humanitarian agencies have mounted one of
their most massive and continuous programmes of assistance. The regional
organizations, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE)
and the European Community, have deployed major efforts in coordination with
the United Nations. Individual nations have donated significant human and
material resources. A peace plan has been engendered which has won the active
S/PV.3203
23
(Mr, Camilleri, Malta)
support of the whole international community, with the exception of the Serb
parties to the conflict.
A series of Security Council and General Assembly resolutions have been
adopted. Sanctions have been applied against the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and have been progressively reinforced.
Measures have been initiated to establish a criminal tribunal to consider the
humanitarian crimes which are being committed. A no-fly zone has been imposed
and military action to enforce it has been authorized. Yet, at the end of all
these efforts, we witness the latest events around Srebrenica, events which
underline the fact that all the best efforts of the international community
have yet to prevail in bringing sanity and legality back to that region
engulfed in tragedy.
In the midst of our justified dismay and frustration that so much effort
has not yet achieved its principal objective, we first must remember and
salute the heroic efforts of those who have been bearing the brunt of the
tragedy - in the first place, the innocent civilians of Bosnia and
Herzegovina:	the women who have been raped, children who have been mutilated,
old people who have been uprooted, and persons of all ages who have been
massacred. We also remember and salute those serving in the fields the
troops of various nations and the officials from the many humanitarian
agencies who at great personal risk persist in seeking and sometimes realizing
some measure of relief even in the midst of all the suffering and bitterness.
We must also express our deep appreciation of the painstaking efforts of the
two Co-Chairmen of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia,
whose patience and diplomatic skills have been instrumental in preserving an
element of hope in an otherwise desperate situation.
S/PV.3203
24
(Mr, Camilleri, Malta)
In taking stock of this situation today, we realize that the
international community continues to be challenged on two major fronts: in
its efforts to protect the inhabitants of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in its
efforts to assert the validity and credibility of the international
institutions entrusted with safeguarding humanitarian behaviour and
international legality. A number of ideas have been suggested over the months
in connection with the need to provide a greater measure of protection to the
inhabitants of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The time has perhaps come when some of
these ideas should be given detailed consideration.
Resolution 47/121, adopted by the General Assembly on 18 December last
year, urges the Security Council to consider both the use of all necessary
means to uphold and restore the sovereignty, political independence,
territorial integrity and unity of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as
well as the possibility of exempting the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina
from the arms embargo imposed on the former Yugoslavia. In its resolution
758 (1992) of 8 June 1992, the Security Council refers to the establishment of
a security zone encompassing Sarajevo and its airport, and the idea of a
security zone, this time in Srebrenica, again appears in last Friday's
resolution 819 (1993).
My Government takes the view that the idea of establishing security zones
around selected areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina constitutes in the present
circumstances a justified and, indeed, necessary measure of protection for the
inhabitants of that country. In a joint letter with the Foreign Minister of
Slovenia addressed to CSCE member States last November, my Foreign Minister
formally proposed:
S/PV.3203
25
(Mr, Camilleri, Malta)
"""Concrete and energetic action by the United Nations in coordination with"
the CSCE, through major concentration of UNPROFOR, to establish and
protect a 'cordon sanitaire' around Sarajevo and other cities in Bosnia
"and Herzegovina""."
The experience of Srebrenica reinforces our belief that timely action in
deploying a resonable number of United Nations peace-keeping troops in
sensitive areas as a measure in the creation of security zones could help to
prevent a continued worsening of dangerous and critical situations. This
would in turn provide some additional space for diplomatic efforts towards a
peaceful settlement to be pursued.
All members of the international community are painfully aware that, if
the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina fails to improve, progressively more
forceful measures would have to be employed. The viability and credibility of
the whole concept of the new international order rests upon this assumption.
For a small country like Malta, which bases its security upon the notion of
regional and international stability and legality, it is imperative that the
institutions entrusted with safeguarding this stability and legality assert
their authority.
S/PV.3203
26
(Mr, Camilleri, Malta)
It is in this spirit that my Government pledges its full commitment to
the efforts which are being undertaken by the international community to bring
peace to the former Yugoslavia. We take this opportunity to reiterate our
commitment to fully support and to take all necessary measures to ensure the
implementation of decisions taken by the Security Council to bring an end to
the many violations of the right to life and other fundamental human rights
which the international community is witnessing in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The PRESIDENTS I thank the representative of Malta for the kind
words addressed to my predecessor and to me.
In accordance with the decision taken at the 3201st meeting, I now invite
Ambassador Dragomir Djokic to take a place at the Council table and to make a
statement.
f	■
Mr, DJOKIC: Instead of meeting to consider the tragic situation m
Bosnia and Herzegovina in its efforts to bring lasting peace to its peoples,
the Security Council has succumbed to pressures for the staging of a general
debate on this issue whose sole aim is apparently to condemn only one side.
Moreover, we see no purpose to this debate since the Council has already
adopted a series of new punitive measures against the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia which can in no way contribute to achieving the goal of a just and
durable peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Those measures are primarily
directed at the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which is not a party to the
civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In doing so, the Security Council has disregarded the reports of the
United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and of the Secretary-General and
has ignored the information provided by the Serbs from Bosnia. In that way,
an inaccurate picture of the situation in Bosnia is being portrayed and,
consequently, one-sided resolutions are adopted at an accelerated pace.
S/PV.3203
27
(Mr, Diokic)
The Council has in the course of the crisis and conflict in Bosnia and
Herzegovina acted very often under the erroneous assumption that the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia is responsible for the outbreak of war and that it can
fundamentally influence the Bosnian Serbs to accept elements of the peace plan
which they find contrary to their vital interests.
Resolution 820 (1993) continues arbitrarily to condemn the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia for its alleged involvement in the crisis in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, although it is evident that Yugoslavia cannot be responsible for
either the outbreak or the continuation of the bloodshed in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. What is at stake is an ethnic, religious and civil war in which
the three nations making up Bosnia and Herzegovina - namely, Muslims, Serbs
and Croats - are taking part. Such a war in Bosnia and Herzegovina is best
exemplified by the ongoing fierce fighting between the Muslim and Croat forces
in Bosnia and Herzegovina with heavy losses on both sides despite their
agreement on military cooperation and joint military activities.
It has been stated on numerous occasions that the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia has no territorial claims on any of its neighbours, as was
confirmed by the Declaration adopted by the Federal Assembly when the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia was constituted on 27 April 1992. Ever since May 1992,
not a single soldier of the Yugoslav army remains in the territory of Bosnia
and Herzegovina, while at the same time 40,000 to 50,000 Croatian troops have
occupied parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This was also confirmed in the
report of the Secretary-General. Despite these facts, however, the
international community in a relentless campaign continues to label Yugoslavia
as the aggressor and calls for its punishment and isolation.
S/PV.3203
28
(Mr, Diokic)
Yugoslavia is vitally interested and fully committed to bringing an end
to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina by peaceful means and dialogue. The
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has invested great efforts to facilitate the
peace process. We have accepted all the decisions and principles of the
London Conference and supported the Vance-Owen plan as a basis for ending the
civil war and the suffering of all three nations.
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has cooperated fully with the two
co-Chairmen during the peace negotiations and has offered its good offices.
With a view to achieving a just and lasting solution, the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia has called for observers to be stationed at all its
airports and along the borders between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and
"Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina;"
proposed a normalization of mutual relations with the former Yugoslav
"Republics, but there was no response; took peace Initiatives on a number of"
"occasions and launched humanitarian actions; and permitted and assisted"
"passage of humanitarian aid convoys for Bosnia and Herzegovina; and it is"
taking care of close to 700,000 refugees from Croatia and Bosnia and
Herzegovina, among them 50,000 Muslims and 15,000 Croats.
Unfortunately, in that resolution and in previous resolutions, the
Security Council has totally ignored the positive role of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia by persistently treating it as a party to the conflict that
should be punished.
The Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and its people
"unreservedly condemned the abhorrent crime of ""ethnic cleansing"" by whomever"
it was committed and wherever it occurred. We have strongly opposed the
holding of ethnic hostages, the shelling of cities, especially Sarajevo, and
the destruction of villages, infrastructure, churches and cultural monuments.
S/PV.3203
29-30
(Mr. Diokic)
Despite our efforts, the Serbian population in Bosnia and Herzegovina and
in the United Nations protected areas were for the past several months
subjected to relentless attacks and aggression. On 22 January 1993, the
territory of Krajina, under the protection and presence of the United Nations,
was flagrantly attacked by Croatian forces in clear violation of the
Vance-Owen plan. Despite the demands contained in resolution 802 (1993),
those attacks have continued unabated and most recently have even been
intensified. No action was taken by the Security Council.
The Muslim and Croatian forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina have continued
their campaign of terror and provocation. During the offensive that was
launched in January 1993, numerous Serbian villages were destroyed in eastern
Bosnia and more than 1,200 Serbs, primarily children, women and elderly
people, were murdered. That did not draw the attention of the world media or
that of the Security Council.
In their efforts to provoke foreign military intervention and involve the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the war, Muslim forces have even gone so far
as to attack the territory and population of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia itself. Our constant appeals to stop Muslim and Croatian
aggression were not heeded by the Security Council. For its part, the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia exerted maximum restraint and kept its response to the
lowest possible level.
S/PV.32O3
31
(Mr, Djokic)
Horrible crimes and atrocities have been committed by all warring parties
on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Those responsible for war crimes
and violations of humanitarian law should be brought to justice. In that
regard, the Government of Yugoslavia supports and is cooperating with the
Commission of Experts established by resolution 780 (1992). With the facts
distorted and ignored, however, a false picture has been projected: that the
Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the United Nations protected areas are
the only culprits. Putting the blame solely on the Serbs and demonizing the
Serbian nation as a whole will not, however, help resolve the conflict, as
there can be no winners in the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
From the outset of the crisis and the outbreak of hostilities on the
territory of the former Yugoslavia, the history of the region and the root
causes of the underlying tensions have been seriously underestimated. In
hasty attempts to address the crisis, the European Community, and later the
international community as a whole, made a series of grave mistakes with
far-reaching conseqneuces. It is now generally recognized that the premature
recognition of former Yugoslav republics before an overall political
settlement was reached triggered the civil war. Numerous statements by
leading political figures including Lord Carrington, Mr. Cyrus Vance and
Lord Owen give clear evidence of this. In an unprecedented train of events in
the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, secession was rewarded,
with priority given to internal borders fashioned in an arbitrary and
undemocratic manner over external, internationally recognized, ones. The
international community had in a matter of months accepted and even encouraged
S/PV.3203
32
(Mr, Diokic)
the breakup of Yugoslavia/ a founding Member of the United Nations. The right
to self-determination of Slovenes, Croats and Muslims was honoured, while the
same right was denied to the Serbs.
The Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina are not aggressors. They
are fighting for their survival on their own land, where they have lived for
centuries.
Yugoslavia has endeavoured to play a constructive role throughout the
peace talks on the former Yugoslavia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. In Geneva
and here in New York we have spared no effort in assisting the Co-Chairmen in
their search for a viable solution and an end to the hostilities and
suffering. It is well known that the leadership of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and the Republics of Serbia and Montenegro played a very important
role in facilitating acceptance by the Bosnian Serbs of significance elements
of the peace plan.
In assisting the peace process we were inspired by the basic premise that
there can be no lasting solution unless it takes into account the vital
interests of all three constituent peoples in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Nor can
a just peace be established by forcibly imposing it on any of the parties.
Unfortunately, in the final elaboration of the Vance-Owen plan
insufficient efforts were exerted to ensure full equality. The maps that were
drawn up and are now being imposed are not wholly acceptable to the Bosnian
Serbs because they are unjust and jeopardize the existential interests of the
Serbs while clearly favouring Croatian and Muslim interests. The plan is seen
as unacceptable by the Bosnian Serbs as it unjustly divides the area and its
mineral resources, energy potential and industrial infrastructure, and does
not correspond to the ethnic composition of the population.
S/PV.3203
33
(Mr, Djokic)
A deadline given as an ultimatum to the Serbs in Bosnia to accept and
sign the Vance-Owen peace plan in its entirety runs counter to the conclusions
of the Geneva negotiations and the adopted principles that agreement would be
sought on the basis of consensus among all three constituent peoples and that
no solution would be imposed.
The question now arises: What is the motive behind ignoring the adopted
principles? Is it to seek an end to the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina or to
seek an excuse for the perpetuation and stepping up of pressure against the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with a view to achieving other ends?
The international community is holding the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia
hostage to the Bosnian Serbs, Muslims and Croats. The conviction that the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia can order the Serbs
in Bosnia to accept something that is a threat to their survival and that the
Bosnian Serbs are ready to obey orders from Belgrade is illusory and false.
We are advising them, and we are doing our utmost in that regard, but we
cannot order people - who are dying and sacrificing everything they have in
order to survive on their land - to capitulate.
We share the concern and impatience of the international community and
fully understand the responsibility of the Security Council in its effort to
reinstate peace and security in the region as a whole. That, however, cannot
be achieved by isolating one side and by exerting unprecedented pressure and
imposing new sanctions on the people of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,
although it is not a party to the conflict, with the aim of implementing
unjust solutions that cannot last.
S/PV.3203
34
(Mr, Pjoki6)
It would be unfortunate indeed if the peace process, which has already
yielded tangible results, were discontinued. We believe that negotiations
should be urgently resumed, as there are possibilities, particularly through
direct talks by the parties concerned, for agreeing on pending issues if
necessary revisions are made to accommodate all sides.
We are confident that the tireless efforts of the Co-Chairmen, Mr. Vance
and Lord Owen, have not been to no avail, and that there is potential for the
continuation of the negotiation process. We appreciate Mr. Vance's
contribution very much, and we look forward to working closely with his
successor, Mr. Stoltenberg.
Yugoslavia has spared no effort in searching for a just and lasting
solution to the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We have fully cooperated
with the special envoys - Deputy Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation,
Mr. Vitaly Churkin, and Ambassador Reginald Bartholomew of the United States
of America - in their endeavours.
The Security Council has decided on a series of inhumane and totally
unjustified measures whose aim is to tighten the noose and strangle the people
of my country regardless of the fact that humanitarian law and rules do not
recognize collective punishment. The sanctions violate fundamental human
rights, punishing innocent people and leaving them without medicine, food and
other elementary goods to keep them alive. With those sanctions the Security
Council is making the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia into a concentration
camp, punishing the Serbian people as a whole, which is an attempt to commit
the third genocide in that people's history. This is not a series of technical
S/PV.3203
35
(Mr. Pjokj.6)
"and economic measures; it is practically a death sentence proclaimed by the"
Security Council on a whole people. The first victims have already been
struck down as a consequence of the present sanctions: newborn babies are
dying in the hospitals because of the lack of medicines and instruments.
As it strives further to increase the economic sanctions, isolation and
collective punishment of the people of Yugoslavia, the Security Council will
add to the tragedy that has befallen the people of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia. The sanctions trample upon numerous international conventions on
human rights, and all Yugoslavs have been demonized and turned into pariahs.
S/PV.3203
36
(Mr. Djokic)
While seeking to avert the ongoing tragedy and suffering of the innocent
victims of the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina by imposing and now
expanding sanctions, the Security Council is inflicting hardships and
suffering on all citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, who can in no
way be responsible for the war in their vicinity. The most vulnerable segment
of the population in Yugoslavia - children, the sick, the elderly and the
frail - are those hardest hit.
The isolation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the quarantine
"imposed on its people cannot lead to peace; it can only contribute to the"
ruining of a whole nation, the creation of more hotbeds of crisis, social and
national destruction in the territory of the former Yugoslavia and the
destabilization of the entire Balkan region. The closing of the international
waterway and the prohibition of navigation on the Danube is itself a measure
which poses a great danger to the region as a whole. The introduction of new
punitive measures can only cause more innocent victims, suffering and
instability.
However, further sanctions cannot objectively stop the civil war in
Bosnia and Herzegovina and bring us any closer to a just and lasting peace.
This is best evidenced in the period since the sanctions were imposed nearly a
year ago. The efforts that Yugoslavia has undertaken to facilitate the peace
process are the result not of pressure and sanctions, but of genuine interest
that peace should prevail in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the territories of
the former Yugoslavia.
The Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had sought to bring
"about a peaceful solution t; the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina, ever since"
its beginning, on the basis of respect for the legitimate interests of all
three peoples and their consensus on the form of their life together. In that
S/PV.3203
37
(Mr. Diokic)
context, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has supported the Vance-Owen plan
as a useful basis for further negotiations aimed at achieving a consensus on
the proposed maps.
The Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia accords absolute
priority to immediate and unconditional cessation of the military conflict and
to the continuation of the negotiations on a peace plan for Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
The Yugoslav Government is convinced that the remaining contentious
issues related to the proposed maps can be resolved and that they should not
put the peace process in jeopardy. To this effect, the Government supported
the appeal of the Bileda Assembly to the international community to help
organize a bilateral meeting between the warring parties and offered its
hospitality and good offices for early, direct negotiations between Bosnian
Serbs and Bosnian Muslims and between Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Croats.
It is evident that lasting peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot be
achieved by imposing non-negotiable solutions on the parties involved.
Undoubtedly, certain elements of the existing plan do not accommodate the
interests of all sides. The only way to reinstate peace is patiently and
tenaciously to continue negotiations so that the vital interests of all three
nations are taken into account and agreement is reached by consensus. In that
process, Yugoslavia should be seen as a partner rather than as an adversary.
As was stated by the Government of Yugoslavia on 18 April of this year,
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia remains fully committed to the policy of
peace and to overcoming the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina by political
means, on the basis of equal respect for the legitimate rights of all three
constituent peoples. In that regard, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will
S/PV.3203
38
(Mr. Diokic)
continue to cooperate closely with ths United Nations and its
representatives. However, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia will firmly
defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity if forced to do so.
The PRESIDENT: The next name inscribed on the list of speakers is
that of the representative of Ireland. I invite him to take a place at the
Council table and to make his statement.
Mr, COLLINS (Ireland): I should like, Mr. President, to associate
my delegation with the remarks made in relation to your eminent personage and
well-known competence. I should like also to say the same about your
predecessor, Ambassador Terence O'Brien.
We are assembled here today to discuss the situation in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. I shall in a moment make a number of points on that matter on
the instructions of my Government. Before doing so, however, I should like to
give a thematic introduction to my remarks by quoting my fellow countryman,
the poet W. B. Yeats, who wrote much on the subject of civil strife. He said
as follows:
"""Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;"
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
The ceremony of innocence is drowned
The best lack all conviction, while the worst
"Are full of passionate intensity."" (The Second Coming, W.B, Yeats)"
There have been signs in recent days that the best - that is, the
international community - are about to demonstrate some conviction in relation
to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Resolution 820 (1993), adopted on Saturday night,
and this debate are testimony to that fact.
S/PV.3203
39
(Mr, Collins, Ireland)
I am grateful to the Security Council for providing me with the
opportunity to put on record the views of the Government of Ireland on the
situation in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
My Government fully shares the concerns which prompted the Non-Aligned
members of the Security Council to seek this debate. It would be
unconscionable were this appalling human tragedy, this grave threat to
international peace and security, not addressed in the Security Council by the
overall membership of the United Nations.
It is not necessary to describe in detail the nature of the horrors that
we are witnessing in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The facts are well known to
all. They stand as an affront to the international community. It is a litany
of barbarism and inhumanity unequalled in Europe since the Second World War.
It is, as the Tanaiste and Deputy Prime Minister of Ireland, Mr. Dick Spring,
described it recently in the Irish Parliament,
"""... the carnage and sheer brutality which we have witnessed in recent"
weeks at Srebrenica and other Muslim towns in eastern Bosnia. It is
almost beyond belief that whole communities of innocent people can be
shelled, starved and held hostage in the pursuit of military and
"political objectives."""
The brutality and atrocities which we have witnessed serve to underline
one basic fact: our objective of securing a comprehensive and durable
settlement to the conflict in former Yugoslavia, but more immediately in
Bosnia and Herzegovina, will only be realized through the determined resolve
and the collective efforts >f the international community.
To this end, Ireland is playing its part with its European Community
partners, at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and
here at the United Nations. The International Conference, under the skilful
S/PV.3203
40
(Mr, Collins, Ireland)
leadership of its Co-Chairmen, has developed a viable plan for Bosnia and
Herzegovina. It has been accepted by two of the Bosnian parties.
We must, at this late stage, spare no effort to secure the agreement of
the Bosnian Serbs. In this regard, my Government warmly welcomes the adoption
by the Security Council of resolution 820 (1993). We welcome in particular
"the support which it has given to the peace plan, its condemnation of ""ethnic"
"cleansing"" and its reaffirmation that those who commit or direct the rape of"
women will be held individually responsible for their actions.
But, most immediately, my Government very much welcomes the fact that the
Security Council has acted decisively to provide for the total isolation of
Serbia and Montenegro, should the Bosnian Serbs fail to sign the peace plan,
begin its implementation and cease their military attacks by 26 April. The
measures to isolate Serbia and Montenegro are Draconian. They have not been
taken lightly.
S/PV.3203
41
•	(Mr. Collins. Ireland)
The authorities in Belgrade face a stark choice: they can ensure that
"the peace plan is accepted, implemented and an end brought to the fighting;"
or, they can decided to condemn Serbia and Montenegro to the hardship which
will follow unprecedented isolation, the price of the callous pursuit of
military and political objectives in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
My Government would have wished that the Security Council could have
f
acted earlier to present this stark choice to the Bosnian Serbs and to
Belgrade. We also welcome, however, the fact that that the Security Council
has, in its resolution 819 (1993) of 16 April, demanded that Srebrenica and
its surroundings be treated as a safe area which should be free from armed
attack, following the murderous onslaught which its inhabitants have suffered
in recent months. We welcome the fact that the Security Council has condemned
the action of the Bosnian Serbs in trying to force the civilian population to
evacuate the Srebrenica area and other parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The respect for the implementation of resolution 819 (1993) in
forthcoming days will demonstrate the degree to which the Bosnian Serbs are
willing to abide by the decisions of the Council.
The basic approach of Irish foreign policy is that international
conflicts should be resolved by negotiation rather than by military means.
However, having set ourselves the task of ending this appalling conflict
through the instruments of negotiation and pressure, we in Ireland, and the
international community at large, share a profound sense of frustration and
outrage at the ongoing violence and bloodshed. What is happening in Bosnia
and Herzegovina is an affront to all civilized values and is a direct
challenge to the authority, of the United Nations and to the Security Council.
I should like to underline the following position of my Goverments if
S/PV.3203
42
(Mr, Collins, Ireland)
the efforts of the international community to find a negotiated solution fail,
the Security Council will need to consider all the options open to it under
i.
the United Nations Charter.'
I profoundly hope that the Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in
Belgrade will reflect on the consequences of rejecting the peace package and,
by cooperating with the United Nations and the European Community, obviate the
need for the consideration by the Security Council of enforcement measures
under Chapter VII of the Charter.
The suffering in Bosnia and Herzegovina must be brought to an end. The
authorities in Belgrade have the power to realize this. At this critical
moment, we look to the Security Council for decisive leadership and firm
action to achieve this goai.
The PRESIDENTt I thank the representative of Ireland for his kind
words addressed to my predecessor and to me.
The next speaker is the representative of Albania. I invite him to take
a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr, SHKURTI (Albania): I extend my congratulations to you, Sir, on
your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the current
month. Your personal accomplishments and your talents as a wise diplomat have
already been reflected in the work of this Council. At the same time, I
present my compliments and, thanks to your predecessor, Ambassador O'Brien of
New Zealand, for his admirable expertise in guiding the work of the Security
Council during last month.,
The Albanian delegation attaches great importance to this open meeting of
the Security Council, being convinced that it will, hopefully, make a
substantial contribution to the solution of a very serious and urgent problem
that of putting an end to the bloody war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
S/PV.3203
43
(Mr, Shkurti, Albania)
The Republic of Albania is particularly concerned about the conflict
there, for that conflict is playing havoc with human lives. The war has been
accompanied by a large number of crimes: thousands of Muslim women raped and
"murdered; the mass destruction of houses; and the forcible displacement of"
people. And all this with the obvious aim of creating ethnically pure Serbian
"areas. ""Ethnic cleansing"", carried out through force of arms against the"
Muslims, has assumed enormous proportions. A great number of cities in Bosnia
and Herzegovina are being kept besieged, and their suffering populations kept
"hostage. Serbian paramilitary units are terrorizing Muslim civilians;"
Srebrenica is a sad example of this. Now there 4s no longer any doubt that
the Serbs of Bosnia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia bear exclusive
responsibility.
The Serbs of Bosnia continue to refuse the peace plan suggested by
Lord Owen and Mr. Cyrus Vance, which has already been accepted by both Muslims
and Croats at a time when Serbia and Montenegro are cynically talking about
their so-called peaceful efforts in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Albania has decisively joined the international community in an endeavour
to find a just and rapid solution to the crisis, and it urges that the leaders
"of the Serbs of Bosnia accept the peace plan; if they do not, they should be"
forced to do so. It is to be regretted that peaceful efforts have so far
proved of no avail.
Also, matters being as they are, Albania expresses its legitimate concern
about a possible overspill of the war into nearby Kosova and the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. That is why Albania has given its full
support to Security Council resolution 816 (1993) on enforcement of the no-fly
zone over Bosnia, and also to resolutions 819 and 820 (1993), and has welcomed
S/PV.3203
44-45
(Mr. Shkurti, Albania)
the commitment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to enforcing the ban
on flights over Bosnia in compliance with resolution 816 (1993). It has also
welcomed Security Council resolution 808 (1993) concerning war crimes in the
former Yugoslavia, and calls for those responsible for the crimes to be
brought to trial immediately.
Furthermore, my country gives full support to the declaration of the
European Community and its member States of 5 April 1993, which stresses that
the time has come to take specific steps to tighten sanctions against Serbia
and Montenegro. The Republic of Albania attaches particular importance to the
fact that the Security Council is dealing with a draft resolution whose aim is
just that - to tighten sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia -
and which would, in the long run, lead to the Bosnian Serbs accepting the
peace plan. But, to our regret, the adoption of the draft resolution is being
postponed, leaving the door open to further atrocities.
It is our hope that a resolution providing for the immediate cessation of
the war, for sanctions - particularly economic sanctions - against the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to be tightened, and for the
heavy weapons of all the belligerents to be put under effective control will
be adopted without further delay.
"The PRESIDENT; I thank the representative of Albania for his kind"
words addressed to my predecessor and to me.
The next speaker is the representative of Denmark. I invite him to take
a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
S/PV.3203
46
Mr, HAAKONSEN (Denmark): Denmark appreciates this opportunity to
participate in the Security Council's debate on the situation in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. The policy of my country on this question is the policy of the
European Community, of which Denmark currently hold the presidency.
The Twelve have consistently worked for a peaceful, political and
comprehensive solution to the present conflict.
Four weeks ago, when the European Community and its member States warmly
commended the decision of the Bosnian Government to sign the Vance-Owen peace
plan, we said we would seek further measures against the Serbs if they refused
to accept the plan. We therefore welcome the fact that the Security Council
on 17 April adopted resolution 820 (1993) imposing strong additional measures
on Serbia and Montenegro if the Serbs do not sign the peace plan and stop
their military aggression by 26 April.
The European Community would rather have seen this resolution adopted
immediately after President Izetbegovic signed the peace plan. But we
understand why the resolution was delayed, although we regret it. We deplore
the use made by the Serb side of the delay. Instead of working towards
acceptance of the Vance-Owen plan and a peaceful solution, the Serbs have
moved farther away from it. Instead of stopping their aggression, they moved
towards Srebrenica, causing terrible suffering there. If the Bosnian Serbs
and the Serbs in Belgrade, where the ultimate decisions are made, do not
reverse their behaviour, they will have brought upon themselves the strong
measures in Security Council resolution 820 (1993).
Denmark, along with the other States members of the European Community,
has given full and unequivocal support to the Var-ce-Owen plan. We believe
that it represents a fair, balanced and viable settlement for Bosnia and
Herzegovina, that it takes into account the legitimate interests of the three
S/PV.3203
47
(Mr. Haaksonsen, Denmark)
communities in the Republic, and that it is the only alternative to a
continuation of a war in which there can only be losers. The lifting of the
arms embargo, more weapons, escalation of violence, and more killing are not
the answer - are not compatible with the cessation of hostilities envisaged in
the Vance-Owen plan. Too many lives have been lost already.
The Twelve have repeatedly stated that a negotiated settlement is the
only solution. And the Vance-Owen plan remains the only basis for this. It
is the result of months of untiring efforts and tough negotiations by the two
co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the joint European Community-United
Nations International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia. I should like to
pay a tribute to Mr. Vance and Lord Owen for the tkill, the commitment and the
sheer hard work they have brought to bear on their formidable task.
Denmark firmly believes that the time for full commitment to the Vance-
Owen plan is now. We and other European Community member States have
committed troops and millions of dollars in humanitarian assistance to the
war-ridden population in Bosnia. Soldiers, voluntary drivers, monitors, aid
workers, doctors and nurses are doing a tremendous job under very difficult
circumstances. We have done this in the cause of. peace. And we shall continue
to press all sides to commit themsleves to peace. We are discouraged by the
renewed fighting between Muslims and Croats in central Bosnia.
We utterly condemn the Serb offensive in eastern Bosnia and the Serbs'
rejection of the peace plan. If the Serb position is unchanged on 26 April,
the Serbs will immediately feel the full weight of the strengthened
international sanctions. The European Community has already made preparations
for these to be applied as intensely as possible, and for as long as it takes
for the decision-makers in Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs to come to their
senses.
I	■
S/PV.3203
48
'	(Mr. Haaksonsen, Denmark)
The message to the Serbs is clear, just as their choice is clear: they
can either cooperate or be subject to further, tough sanctions leading to the
total international isolation of Serbia and Montenegro for years to come.
Denmark and the European Community hope and expect that President
Milosevic will realize that this is too high a price to pay for continued
aggression in Bosnia and Herzegovina. And we strongly urge the leader of the
Bosnian Serbs, Mr. Radovan Karadzic, to sign the Vance-Owen plan now. This
I	’
will be the only way to the restoration of peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The only way back to integration into the international community for Serbia
and Montenegro and for the gradual lifting of sanctions is acceptance of the
peace plan as a whole and full and effective cooperation on implementation of
all of its elements.
The PRESIDENT: The next speaker is the representative of Sierra
Leone. I invite him to take a place at the Council table and to make his
statement.
Mr. KOROMA (Sierra Leone): If the events unfolding in Bosnia and
Herzegovina today were intended merely to mock the Security Council, if the
events unfolding in Bosnia and Herzegovina today were intended to challenge
the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, if the outrages being
perpetrated today in Bosnia and Herzegovina were intended merely to send shock
waves through the conscience of the international community, then perhaps the
tragedy could be tolerated by this Council.
But, alas, what we are witnessing in Bosnia and Herzegovina today is not
"merely tragic; we are not only witnessing the anguish and suffering of a"
people. What we are witnessing also engages the fundamental principle and
precept of this Organization - that is, the non-use of force against the
S/PV.3203
49-50
(Mr, Koroma, Sierra Leone)
sovereignty and territorial integrity of a Member State of the Organization.
Furthermore, what we are witnessing fundamentally engages the principles of
human rights, including the right to life and the dignity and worth of the
human person.
Today, as the world watches, aggression and genocide are being committed
in Bosnia and Herzegovina with impunity. Thereby, not only are the principles
of the Charter of this Organization being mocked and openly violated, but the
credibility of the Security Council is being seriously undermined.
We are indeed aware that the Council has taken some measures to put an
and to such flagrant violations of international law as those being
perpetrated in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We are indeed aware that the United
Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) has been deployed in Bosnia and
Herzegovina. We salute all those who are serving in that peace-keeping force
on behalf of the international community for their courage - in particular
General Morillon, whom we applaud for his efforts to save the lives of those
hapless people of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We are also aware, of course, of the efforts made by certain European
States to stem the tide of events in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We are aware of
the declared intention of President Clinton to put a stop to the atrocities
being committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina today. We are aware of the
intention of the Clinton Administration. If only that Administration could
carry the rest of the membership of the Security Council with it to engage the
criminals in Bosnia and Herzegovina today.
S/PV.3203
51
(Mr, Koroma, Sierra Leone)
We applaud the Clinton Administration and call upon the American people
to act on behalf of the international community to put an end to the travesty
that is taking place in Bosnia and Herzegovina today, despite the
unwillingness of certain members of the Security Council, perhaps not through
malice but for other reasons, to act in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
So what we are witnessing in Bosnia and Herzegovina is not the failure of
individual actions. As we,see it, it is the failure of the Council to act
i
collectively: to rise to its responsibility for the maintenance of
international peace and security. And that is why we are speaking before this
Council: to call on the Security Council to rise to its responsibility as the
custodian of international peace and security and to put an end to the human
suffering that is taking place in Bosnia and Herzegovina today.
That is our purpose in coming here. We do not come here to address the
conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina in terms of religion. We refuse to accept
that the perpetrators of crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina are acting in the
name of any biblical injunction. I think that would be a travesty of
Christianity - or of any religion, for that matter. We refuse to see this
struggle in terms of Muslims and Christians. What we are observing in Bosnia
and Herzegovina is man's inhumanity to man and certain motivations of
territorial aggrandizement. It is the responsibility of the Security Council
to put a stop to such ill intentions and motivations.
Seven months ago, when the President of my country addressed the General
Assembly, he stated that:
"""What the world continues to witness in the former Yugoslavia defies"
human comprehension. The gravity and consequences of that war are
"reminiscent of conduct that the world had wished was only a memory."""
S/PV.3203
52
(Mr. Koroma, Sierra Leone)
He went on to call for an end to hostilities and the resolution of the
conflict by peaceful means. Similar calls have been made repeatedly by peace-
loving people all over the world who, mindful of the long twilight of
uncertainty they endured during the cold war, had hoped - indeed, had
expected - that nations, large and small, would at last demonstrate a
scrupulous adherence to the obligations they had assumed under the Charter of
this Organization. Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Member States and the outlawing of aggression are guiding principles which
shape and direct the policies of modern nations. They remain eternal,
enduring as assurance for the security and protection of all States, and
particularly Members of this Organization.
Since that call was made by my Head of State some seven months ago, all
of us have become unwilling spectators to a growing tragedy as the people of
Bosnia and Herzegovina continue to pay the ultimate price for daring to aspire
to the ideals of freedom and self-determination enshrined in the Charter of
our Organization. My country feels deeply the plight of the people of Bosnia
and Herzegovina, victims of aggression and genocide.
"We talk about ""ethnic cleansing"", running away from what has been"
adumbrated and given imprimatur since 1949. I am referring to the genocide
Convention. It is there in the books. Instead of calling things by their
"name, the Council speaks of ""ethnic cleansing"" because we know that Certain"
responsibilities flow from any commission of the act of genocide. So why do
"we talk about ""ethnic cleansing"" when we know full well that we are talking"
about an act which is being perpetrated against the conscience of the
international community and the conscience of mankind? We are talking about
aggression and genocide, two of the worst offences in the book. It is
S/PV.3203
53
(Mr,. Koroma, Sierra Leone)
therefore for the Council, the sole responsibility of which is the maintenance
of international peace and security, and which is responsible for protecting
the rights and dignity and lives of humans, to rise to the occasion and take
its responsibilities seriously.
As a consequence of the Serbs' pursuit of their territorial ambitions,
the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina has deepened. Massacres, rapes,
concentration camps - we have all been living witnesses of these and have seen
them on our televisions - have been instruments with which the war has been
pursued in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We have witnessed the gravest violations
of humanitarian law in recent times, as the President of the International
Committee of the Red Cross recently reminded us, xn addition to the wholesale
displacement of communities within Bosnia and Herzegovina itself. The
international community has not failed to condemn these unspeakable acts of
barbarism and genocide, committed by agents who harbour the false belief that
the world will remain indifferent to those atrocities.
Equally serious and intensive efforts have been made to bring peace to
the situation, to put an end to the carnage, and to minimize the prospect of
escalation. This Council's imposition of sanctions, the deployment of the
United Nations Protection Force, the institution of an arms embargo and the
ban of flights over the airspace of Bosnia and Herzegovina were all designed
to effect a speedy resolution of the conflict. Even the formula proposed by
former Secretary of State Vance and former Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs Lord Owen, with all its misgivings, carried similar
expectations that at the end of the day the suffering of the people of Bosnia
and Herzegovina and our common humanity would prevent a further escalation of
this conflict and bring it to an end.
S/PV.3203
54
(Mr. Koroma, Sierra Leone)
Yet this objective has not been realized, as the international
community's will continues to be flouted. Town after town and one village
after another falls to the guns of the aggressors, who have demonstrated their
blatant disregard for the principles of international law and their utter
I
disrespect for the norms of international law and civilized behaviour. Even
as I speak here, the slaughter of the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina
continues.
The Sierra Leone delegation remains convinced that the international
community, representing the conscience of humanity, cannot fail to be moved by
the cries of pain and anguish raised by mothers and children who mourn daily
for husbands and fathers they will never see again, for values they will never
regain, and for homes to which they may never return. Neither can we allow
the violence of this conflict to paralyze us nor should we preside with
indifference over what amounts to an attempt to extinguish a Member State.
Bosnia and Herzegovina must not be allowed to become extinct.
It is now clear that time is running out for the people of Bosnia and
Herzegovina. Every day that passes brings closer the achievement of the goal
of Serbian aggression and undermines further the victims' belief that the
United Nations will act vigorously in defence of their rights. This faith
should not become another casualty of this conflict. Much as the courage and
fortitude of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina are admired, their struggle
J
to live the lives they have chosen for themselves should not be seen as an
isolated event the outcome of which has no consequences for our own
existence. If we allow the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina to become extinct,
the world will be the poorer for it. The genocide being perpetrated against
the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina makes us all the poorer.
S/PV.3203
55
(Mr, Koroma, Sierra Leone)
We are all in the same boat. We cannot turn a blind eye and say that the
atrocities are being committed in a far-away land. I come from Africa, a long
way from Bosnia and Herzegovina, but we share a common identity and a common
humanity with the people of that country, and that is why we have asked to
speak before the Council today. On the contrary, we will not remain unchanged
by this experience, for it violates the precepts on which this Organization
was established, and it calls to mind the words of a contemporary statesman:
"""History teaches perhaps few clear lessons. But surely one such"
lesson learned by the world at great cost is that aggression unopposed
"becomes a contagious disease."""
We have seen this in -.he past. Therefore, it is the view of the Sierra
Leone delegation that this Council should seize this moment to exercise its
responsibility and its authority as the custodian of international peace and
security, to put an end to this tragedy and restore the independence,
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to stop
the genocide that is being played out in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
S/PV.3203
56
(Mr, Koroma, Sierra Leone)
We expect that the Council's deliberations will result in the adoption
and implementation of measures from which the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina
will draw strength and succour, and we hope that the world has not turned its
back on them.
Today the blood of countless victims of agression calls out for justice
from the Council - that the crimes perpetrated against them should not go
unpunished. We must hearken to their cries, if only to avoid debasing the
members' time and the debate which is taking place in the Council. Whether it
be the tightening of sanctions, the establishment of a war crimes tribunal or
some sort of military option we are convinced that only the forceful and
unequivocal action that this crisis demands of the Council - that is, the use
of all necessary measures - can halt the carnage taking place in Bosnia and
Herzegovina today. We remain hopeful that the Council will rise to its
responsibility, that the Council will share our concern as a small State.
I cannot end without congratulating you, Sir, on your assumption of the
presidency of the Council for this month. We have every confidence that,
under your able direction, the Council will continue to be actively engaged in
discharging its responsibilities for the maintenance of international peace
and security. We have already seen evidence of that and we applaud you. We
are encouraged by the role you are playing in the Council.
We would also like to convey our appreciation to your predecessor,
Ambassador Terence O'Brien of New Zealand, for the consummate skill with which
he guided the Council's deliberations last month.
The PRESIDENT: I thank the representative of Sierra Leone for his
kind words addressed to my predecessor and to me.
S/PV.3203
57
(The President)
The next speaker is the representative of Argentina. I invite him to
take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
Mr, CARDENAS (Argentina) (interpretation from Spanish): I should
like to thank you, Sir, for your able leadership and guidance of these
meetings as President of the Council. I also want to thank the Security
Council for the opportunity that these meetings provide my country to express
its opinion on this question.
The Government of the Republic of Argentina has expressed in the past and
now wishes to reiterate its condemnation of the grave violations of human
rights and of the rights of minorities systematically occurring in Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
The attacks on the civilian population cannot fail to provoke the most
clear-cut repudiation of the intolerance that causes them. Our concern has
grown week after week in direct proportion to the atrocities. The news and
the images that reach us fill us with profound sadness and legitimate concern.
The International Court of Justice itself - the guardian of the legality
of the international order - has just alerted us to the need to avoid
genocide, a crime against the dignity of the human being which entails the
responsibility of States and individuals alike.
The level of barbarity that we recently witnessed in Srebrenica cannot go
on with impunity, nor can the massive deportations and forced expulsions of
the civilian population, the deliberate attacks on non-combatants, hospitals
and ambulances, or the repeated interruptions in the flow of medical supplies,
food and other humanitarian assistance. All of this is an affront to our
conscience and constitutes a flagrant violation of the basic norms of
international law.
S/PV.3203
58
(Mr. Cardenas, Argentina)
We are concerned at the effect of the arms embargo against Bosnia and
Herzegovina, for it leaves it defenceless in the face of aggression.
We do not for this reason, however, accept that the aggressors should
place us in the position of a moral compulsion to recommend, in this forum,
the lifting of that embargo. We remain inclined to make every effort for an
immediate peaceful solution. Therein resides our conviction, and hence we
make a last appeal to the aggressors that they come to the negotiating table
in good faith in order to achieve the immediate solution that is offered to
them.
"""Ethnic cleansing"" is an insult to mankind, and it deserves our firm and"
explicit condemnation. Those responsible for it must, sooner or later, answer
for their conduct.
In the face of this tragic situation, Argentina, which has a long
tradition of friendship with all the peoples of the former Yugoslavia,
reiterates its resolve to support the international efforts to try to resolve
"this crisis; and we strongly support the action of the Security Council."
In this framework we are contributing a significant number of troops to
the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). Last year we participated in
the Conference on humanitarian assistance to the victims of the conflict and
attended the special emergency session of the Commission on Human Rights in
Geneva on the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Argentina is currently participating in various peace-keeping operations
in Central America, Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East. We have
significantly increased our participation in these operations, and we shall
continue to maintain our presence, since Argentina is convinced that this
constitutes a commitment not only to those countries where we have troops
S/PV.3203
59
(Mr, Cardenas, Argentina)
but also to the United Nations as an instrument for the promotion of
international peace and security. Without such forces, and in particular
those of Canada, the tragedy in Srebrenica would have been even greater.
In this context, we supported and joined in the appeals made by the
Security Council to all the parties in the conflict to take the necessary
measures in order to ensure the safety of the UNPROFOR personnel. Their
presence is the only light in the deep darkness of the crisis today.
At this time we wish to ask, like all those other countries that are
generously contributing their troops in the former Yugoslavia for the cause of
peace, that we be informed and listened to in respect of possible future
action in the region. It is obvious that we have an abiding interest.
As a specific contribution to the efforts aimed at allaying the human
suffering, the Goverment of Argentina has informed the authorities of Bosnia
and Herzegovina and of Croatia that my country, with the coordination of the
International Red Cross, is prepared to receive orphans from both countries,
and we are prepared to take charge of the travel arrangements and care of
those children that have been afflicted by the violence and to bring them to
Buenos Aires.
In order to avoid further loss of life and property, the Government of
Argentina once again urges all the parties involved in the crisis to renew
their efforts for a peaceful solution and to respect the territorial integrity
of all the States of the. region.
"Let this be clear; authority over territory cannot be acquired by"
force. The prohibition of the use of force presupposes the elimination of
conquest as grounds for claiming such authority.
S/PV.3203
60
(Mr, Cardenas, Argentina)
The refusal to recognize territorial acquisitions as a result of the use
of force means total rejection of the legal validity of all acts by the
occupier on the occupied territory.
On behalf of my Government, I wish to express the firmest support for the
peace plan presented by the Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the
International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, as announced by the
Secretary-General in document S/25479, dated 26 March 1993, a plan which is in
the context of the principle of the peaceful and negotiated settlement of
disputes.
S/PV.3203
61
(Mr, ..Cardenas, Argentina)
The basis of that plan must be safeguarded before the plan becomes a
theoretical exercise. The plan is the only option ready to hand for stopping
the bloodshed and ending the tragedy. It is the only foundation on which we
can build. It will not be ‘easy, but it will be impossible so long as military
activity continues.
We support the provisions of the Security Council1s recent resolutions
819 (1993) and 820 (1993), and those of earlier related resolutions. The
latest resolution sends a clear and forceful message to the side that
continues to resort to the use of force in its attempt to violate the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Bosnia and
Herzegovina.
Perhaps it is time also to consider making the aggressor responsible for
the costs incurred by the United Nations in its efforts to secure peace:
those efforts have been made necessary by repeated non-compliance with
Security Council resolutions. This is, of course, without prejudice to other
responsibilities the aggressor may bear.
Any international conflict has unforeseeable consequences. Neighbouring
peoples and countries of the former Yugoslavia are suffering economic and
social effects the international community must also consider in terms of the
norms of international coexistence and in the spirit of Article 50 of the
Charter.
In exercise of its sovereign rights, Argentina will study the
implementation of additional, bilateral, measures.
S/PV.32O3
62
(Mr, Cardenas, Argentina)
It is time to eliminate any possible sanctuary for crimes whose very
nature disgusts mankind. Here the principal responsibility lies with the
i
Security Council. It is time to put an end to the suffering of an innocent
civilian population whose only sin is to profess a different religion.
Half a century ago, Anne Frank wrote in her diary:
"""I can feel the suffering of millions, but if I raise my eyes to"
heaven I believe everything will turn out all right. I believe that this
cruelty too will end, and that peace and tranquility will return once
"more""."
l)
That is a shared dream. Today Anne Frank belongs to us all, thank God. She
is of no particular religion or race. Hers is the voice of mankind, the
interior voice of the conscience.
The passage of time and delayed decisions worry us. Whatever the reason,
the cost is counted in deaths and atrocities. Any delay is therefore
inexplicable. It is time to cooperate firmly and consistently to restore
peace to men and women who are defenceless but who live in hope.
That is our commitment through the United Hations, the sole body able to
put an end to an aggression that is an affront to us all. Ours must be
concerted action as an international community determined to ensure peace and
the rule of law. We - civilians and military alike - reiterate our readiness
to continue to cooperate in complete unity, drawing our clear inspiration from
Article 1 of the Charter.
The PRESIDENT: I thank the representative of Argentina for his kind
words to me.
The next speaker is the representative of the Czech Republic. I invite
him to take a place at the Council table and to make his statement.
S7PV.3203
63
Mr, GALUSKA (Czech Republic): Let me express my sincere pleasure/
Sir, at seeing you in the presidency of the Security Council for this month.
My delegation is convinced that under your able guidance the Council will be
successful in dealing with the important and difficult tasks it faces this
month.
I should like also to congratulate your predecessor. Ambassador
Terence O'Brien of New Zealand, on the great job he did during his presidency
in the month of March.
All of us have been consistently describing the situation in the
territory of the former Yugoslavia, and particularly Bosnia and Herzegovina,
•I
in dark terms. Let me join others in deploring and condemning the horrors
taking place in that heavily tortured part of our continent by using the words
of the most competent representative of all sitting here. Ambassador Muhamed
Sacirbey has said:
"""Genocide and aggression are two powerful words in any language or"
tone. They convey images that shock and frighten civilized mankind.
"These are the images of present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina""."
(S/PV.3201, p, 7)
The catastrophic dimensions of the situation are fully evident in the
horrendous loss of innocent human lives, the massive violation of human
rights, the devastation of the country and the continuing flight of thousands
of refugees.
The Czech Republic is directly interested in the political, security and
economic stability of Central and Eastern Europe. The stability of the region
has been seriously violated by the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, which
has a negative effect on the security situation throughout Europe.
S/PV.3203
64
fMr, Galuska. Czech Republic)
Since the conflict started# the Czech Republic has always insisted on a
peaceful and democratic settlement arrived at by political means. We support
unequivocally the implementation of the Vance-Owen plan and of the mandate of
the units of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) operating in the
former Yugoslavia. We consider the role of our UNPROFOR unit as an active
contribution to the solution of the crisis, and would like it to continue its
operations. Allow me in this context to pay a particular tribute to
Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, and all those who work with them, for their
tireless efforts.
The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina calls for a solution based on
agreement among all three parties concerned. The Czech Republic will respect
any outcome of the negotiations, on the condition that it prevents further
bloodshed and justly reflects the interests of all the participants in the
conflict.
Recent developments have proved that the Serb party is failing to show
sufficient will to achieve a political solution of the conflict. Should the
representatives of the Bosnian Serbs not accept the Vance-Owen plan within the
defined period of time, the Czech Republic will support further decisive
action by the Security Council.
A great deal of time has alrady elapsed without the Bosnian Serbs
accepting a negotiated settlement to the conflict. We welcome the recent
adoption of Security Council resolution 820 (1993) on tightening economic
sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugosla/ia (Serbia and Montenegro).
We believe the strengthening of the sanctions regime, considered by many to be
not as comprehensive as might be desired, can nevertheless have a positive
impact on the situation. Among other positive steps, we would mention the ban
S/PV.3203
65
(Mr. Galuska, Czech Republic)
"on military flights over Bosnia's airspace; the decision to facilitate the"
"delivery of humanitarian aid; and last but not least the fact that the Former"
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has become a Member of the United Nations,
which we consider also as a step that enhances stability in the region.
At the same time, it is becoming more and more apparent that a peaceful
solution of the situation in the former Yugoslavia can hardly be achieved by
diplomatic means alone. In that sense, we view resolution 816 (1993) on the
enforcement of the no-fly zone as an expression of the political resolve of
the international community actively to settle th* conflict in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, and we support it fully.
We regard the situation in Kosovo as very serious. There is a threat of
another open conflict which could spread into neighbouring States. In our
opinion the regions of Sandjak and Vojvodina could also become focuses of
future conflicts. That is why we consider the activities of the monitoring
"missions in those regions to be very important; we are preparing our own staff"
to take part in them.
We condemn the massive eviction of inhabitants from conquered regions,
"known by the term ""ethnic cleansing"". The flow of refugees from the former"
Yugoslavia has become a problem for the whole of Europe, posing a threat to
the internal stability and security of States. The Czech Republic has been
providing humanitarian aid for refugees on its own soil, as well as for the
former Yugoslav republics.
We insist on a thorough investigation of the war crimes committed in the
region of the former Yugoslavia and demand punishment of the guilty in
accordance with Security Council resolution 808 (1993).
S/PV.3203
66
(Mr, Galuska,
Czech Republic)
I am sure we are all painfully aware of the extremely grave and steadily
worsening humanitarian situation, in particular in places like Sarajevo and
Srebrenica. Among the most urgent needs is the prevention of more bloodshed
and the reinforcement of existing humanitarian operations. The Security
Council must mark its actions in this regard with meaningful enforcement
machinery and serious political will.
As I started my statement by quoting Ambassador Sacirbey of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, let me, with his kind permission, conclude in the same way. All
that is happening in the former Yugoslavia now gives rise to
"""an obligation on the part of the community of nations to take concrete"
steps to halt immediately the actions those words [aggression and
"genocide] represent."" (S/PV.3201, p.7)"
The PRESIDENT: I thank the representative of the Czech Republic for
his kind words addressed to my predecessor and to me.
There are no further names on the list of speakers. The next meeting of
the Security Council to continue the consideration of the item on the agenda
will be fixed in consultation with the members of the Council.
The meeting rose at 5.30 p.m.
