ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
The agenda was adopted.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY-GENERAL PURSUANT TO SECURITY COUNCIL
RESOLUTION 807 (1993)	(S/25470 and Add.l)
"The PRESIDENT; I have received a letter from the representative of"
Croatia, in which he requests to be invited to participate in the discussion
of the item on the Council's agenda. In conformity with the usual practice, I
propose, with the consent of the Council, to invite that representative, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter and rule 37 of the
Council's provisional rules of procedure.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
At the invitation of the President, Mr. Nobilo (Croatia) took a place at
the Council table.
The PRESIDENT: The Security Council will now begin its
consideration of the item on its agenda.
The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.
Members of the Council have before them the report of the
Secretary-General pursuant to Security Council resolution 807 (1993), which is
contained in document S/25470 and Add.l.
Members of the Council also have before them document S/25481, which
contains the text of a draft resolution prepared in the course of the
Council's consultations.

(The President)
I should like to draw the attention of the members of the Council to the
following documents: S/25350, S/25454 and S/25477, letters dated 1 March,
22 March and 26 March 1993, repectively, the first from the Charge d'Affaires
a.i. of the-Permanent Mission of Croatia to the United Nations and the lat.ter
two from the Permanent Representative of Croatia to the United Nations
"addressed to the President of the Security Council; S/25447, letter dated"
19 March 1993 from the Permanent Representative of Croatia to the United
"Nations addressed to the Secretary-General; S/25381 and S/25382, letters dated"
8 March 1993 from the Charge d'Affaires a.i. of the Permanent Mission of
"Yugoslavia to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General; and"
S/25449, letter dated 22 March 1993 from the Charge d'Affaires a.i. of the
Permanent Mission of Yugoslavia to the United Nations addressed to the
President of the Security Council.
It is my understanding that the Council is ready to proceed to the vote
on the draft resolution before it. If I hear no objection, I shall take it
that that is the case.
There being no objection, it is so decided.
Before putting the draft resolution to the vote, I shall call on those
members of the Council who wish to make statements before the voting.
Mr. LADSOUS (France) (interpretation from French): Something over a
month ago, when the Council considered the question of renewing the mandate of
the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), my delegation put forward two
priority considerations which remain unchanged today: to guarantee better
security for the Force, which, in extremely difficult circumstances, is
"carrying out its mission in an exemplary way; and to take account of the"
S/PV.3189
4
EMS/1/3964V
(Mr. Ladsous, France)
exceptional conditions and of a particularly changeable diplomatic and
military context. The first consideration prompted us to advocate recourse to
Chapter VII of the Charter and to provisions of a technical kind. The second
consideration dictated renewal of the Force's mandate for a limited period.
That remains valid today, and we therefore welcome the draft resolution
on which we are about to take action because it responds to that dual
imperative. It strengthens the recourse to Chapter VII by extending it to the
question of UNPROFOR's freedom of movement. At the same time, the draft
resolution extends the Force's mandate for an interim period and provides for
the Council's reconsideration, within a month, of the situation of the Force
and, if necessary, to draw the appropriate conclusions.
Without doubt, we are at a turning-point in the history of UNPROFOR. In
the weeks to come the Council will certainly have to take important decisions,
whatever the outcome of the negotiations conducted by the Co-Chairmen of the
Steering Committee of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia.
Should they succeed - and we earnestly hope they will - we shall need to work
"for the implementation of the peace plan; we shall have to focus our efforts"
on the situation in Croatia as well as in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in
Macedonia. The Council will need to retain a comprehensive approach, and the
principle of a unified theatre will have to be maintained from both the
political and the military points of view. Moreover, United Nations authority
over all the peace-keeping operations in the former Yugoslavia must be
preserved.
Should the fighting continue, a whole series of very firm measures will
have to be considered and implemented. Those decisions could include the use
EMS/1/3964V	S/PV.3189
5
(Mr, Ladsous, France)
of all necessary means to strengthen the monitoring of the embargo, or even
"the adoption of new measures; the deployment or reinforcement of observers on"
"the Bosnian-Croatian border; the broadening of the application of Chapter VII"
"when the mandate of the Force is next renewed; or even, if the situation calls"
for it, the partial or total withdrawal of the Force.
S/PV.3189

JP/td/0155V
(Mr, Ladsous, France)
The parties concerned must, however, know that the Council will continue
to act with determination. On the ground, UNPROFOR must be aware of our
commitment to guarantee the security of its missions.
Lastly, the principle of respect for Croatia's territorial integrity must
be solemnly established. The French delegation welcomes the fact that the
whole Council shares this approach, as the draft resolution we are about to
adopt shows.
Mr. PEDAUYE (Spain) (interpretation from Spanish): I wish to begin
by expressing my delegation's gratitude to the Secretary-General for the
report (S/25470 and Add.l) he has submitted to us pursuant to resolution
807 (1993).
We are about to extend the mandate of the United Nations Protection Force
(UNPROFOR) when there still persist fundamental differences between the
positions of the representatives of the Government of Croatia and of the
Serbian populations living in the United Nations Protected Areas and the pink
zones.
As the Secretary-General says in his report, more time will be needed for
the negotiations to be brought to a meaningful conclusion, and UNPROFOR's
presence in Croatia continues to be an essential stabilizing factor.
We must also bear in mind that the extension of UNPROFOR's mandate will
affect the future of the Force in the other Republics where it is deployed,
and that the situation, above all in Bosnia and Herzegovina, is still fluid
and uncertain.
The deployment of UNPROFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina helps to alleviate
the desperate humanitarian situation afflicting that Republic. In that
connection, my delegation would point out that the Spanish infantry battalion
assigned to UNPROFOR has so far escorted about 400 convoys organized by the
JP/td/0155V
S/PV.3189
7
(Mr, Pedauye, Spain)
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), covering
long distances by road in very difficult, and dangerous conditions and making
possible the delivery of some 20,000 tons of humanitarian aid, a large part of
all the humanitarian relief distributed in that Republic.
In this context, my country fully agrees with the Secretary-General that
UNPROFOR's mandate should be extended for a further interim period of three
months, and therefore my delegation will vote in favour of the draft
resolution.
Furthermore, and in order to emphasize the interim nature of this
extension, in view of the circumstances I have just mentioned, we believe that
the Security Council should reconsider UNPROFOR's mandate in a month's time,
or at any time at the Secretary-General's request, in the light of
developments in the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia and the
situation on the ground.
Finally, my delegation would like to emphasize that, in accordance with
the recommendation in paragraph 5 of the Secretary-General's report of
25 March, all UNPROFOR activities will be incorporated in the United Nations
budget for a period of three months beginning on 1 April 1993. Thus the
deployment of UNPROFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina will no longer be funded by
"the unusual method employed so far; all UNPROFOR activities in the former"
Yugoslavia will be financed in the normal manner - that is, by assessments on
the peace-keeping scale levied on all Member States.
The PRESIDENT: I shall now put the draft resolution to the vote.
S/PV.3189

Morocco, New Zealand, Pakistan, Russian Federation, Spain,
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Unit®^
States of America, Venezuela
The PRESIDENT: There were 15 votes in favour. The draft resoluti0
has therefore been adopted unanimously as resolution 815 (1993).
I shall now call on those members of the Council who wish to make
statements following the voting.
Mr. ERDOS (Hungary) (interpretation from French): Hungary voted i-11
favour of resolution 815 (1993), even though it is not capable of giving us
the important answers we await to resolve the situation in Croatia. The
resolution cannot yet give us precise indications of the tasks that the Unite
Nations will have to bear in the future in the settlement of the crisis of th
former Yugoslavia.
We regret to have to note, as was the case during the adoption a few
weeks ago of resolution 807 (1993 ), another postponement of the definitive
formulation of the mandate of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR).
That is because of continuing differences between the positions of the partie
concerned and because conditions on the ground that would promote success in
the current negotiations are lacking.
UNPROFOR has recently had to deal with unprecedented situations which
have enlarged its field of action. We pay tribute to its personnel, who, in
increasingly difficult conditions, demanding cool-headedness and courage, hay
done everything necessary to carry out its duties on the ground. I wish
particularly to mention the exceptional actions of General Morillon,
JP/td/0155V
S/PV.3189
9-10
(Mr, Erdos, Hungary)
Commander-in-Chief of UNPROFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina, who, with his
personal courage and sense of justice, has shown invaluable solidarity with
the civilian populations mercilessly attacked, starved and besieged in eastern
Bosnia. We are convinced that his actions will go down in the history of
United Nations peace-keeping operations and will live in the memory of the
Bosnian people.
After the adoption of today's resolution, efforts must continue
relentlessly to settle questions relating to UNPROFOR's mandate. This will
have to be done in the light of developments in the International Conference
on the Former Yugoslavia and the situation on the ground. In this regard, we
are at a critical stage, of crucial importance for the future of settlement
plans for various parts of the former Yugoslav federation. In this context,
there was recently a major step in the right direction, with an event that we
welcomed in this Chamber, in the presence of the President of the Republic of
Bosnia and Herzegovina.
We do not regard the resolution adopted today as merely a technical
extension of UNPROFOR's mancate for another, interim three-month period. The
resolution once again affirms that any future mandate, whatever it may be,
must be based on respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of
Croatia, and that the United Nations Protected Areas are an integral part of
the territory of the Republic of Croatia. The Security Council is thus once
again clearly establishing the framework in which the parties in conflict in
Croatia will have to continue political negotiations.
S/PV.3189
11
JRS/3/3961
(Mr, Erdos, Hungary)
Security Council resolution 815 (1993) is not exclusively technical in
nature, for it also makes it possible to speed up the work designed to
implement effectively the United Nations peace plan for Croatia. We believe
that the time is ripe to devise, parallel with the continuation of political
negotiations, measures to enhance trust between the two sides which would most
certainly be well received by all of the civilian population living in the
regions in question. Such measures would be aimed at re-establishing normal
living conditions in those regions and restoring essential services to meet
the needs of the civilian population. Those measures could include the
revamping of some aspects of infrastructure, such as the major road networks,
the electricity system, the Adria oil pipeline and so on. These could be the
subject of thorough study before the end of the one-month period mentioned in
the resolution and could lead to a reconsideration of the UNPROFOR mandate
along the lines, among other things, of specific assistance that the Blue
Berets could lend to these operations.
Such measures would be extremely useful for restoring confidence in the
future. They would make this interim period more tolerable and would point
towards the advent of a qualitative change in the situation, which would in no
way prejudge the positions of the parties at the negotiating table. Such
developments could also have positive effects in terms of full respect for
human rights, international humanitarian law and especially the rights of
national minorities and harmonious coexistence, in the future, of different
ethnic communities.
Hungary would like to express its fervent hope that in the near future
the international community will be able, with the very desirable cooperation
of the parties to the conflict, to make a decisive contribution leading to the
restoration of peace in the regions where UNPROFOR is deployed and the
JRS/3/3961
S/PV.3189

(Mr. Erdos, Hungary)
start-up of a major United Nations operation aimed at ensuring security,
stablity and the achievement of a just a lasting settlement in that region of
the world.
Ms, ALBRIGHT (United States of America) : We welcome the adoption of
the resolution extending the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)
mandate to 30 June 1993 . We recognize that the men and women of UNPROFOR are
doing their best in a difficult situation to contain the fighting and to
create conditions that could lead to the peaceful resolution of the conflict
in the former Yugoslavia.
That being said, United Nations efforts, unfortunately, have not been
totally successful at achieving their goals. In Croatia, for example, the
inability of UNPROFOR to implement the United Nations peace-keeping plan has
been partially responsible for the renewal of fighting. That is why the
Council is now acting to create conditions for the complete implementation of
that plan.
We also believe it important to stress that the United Nations protected
"areas ""are integral parts of the territory of the Republic of Croatia"","
"(resolution 815 (1993), para, 5) No amount of ""ethnic cleansing"" by the"
parties to the conflict will change that fact.
Finally, we call on all parties to the conflict throughout the former
Yugoslavia to respect international humanitarian law and to comply with all
relevant Security Council resolutions.
Mr, MARKER (Pakistan): My delegation welcomes the Security
Council's adoption of resolution 815 (1993), which, inter alia, reaffirms its
commitment to ensure respect for the sovereignty and terriorial integrity of
Croatia and the other Republics where the United Nations Protection Force
(UNPROFOR) is deployed. We take note of the resolution's paragraph 3, which
"states that the Council will ""reconsider"", within a period of 30 days,"
S/PV.3189

JRS/3/3961
(Mr, Marker, Pakistan)
"""UNPROFOR's mandate in light of developments of the International"
"Conference on the Former Yugoslavia and the situation on the ground"","
(resolution 815 (1993), para. 3)
In this context my delegation expresses its deep appreciation for the
fact that the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnian Croat side
have now signed all the documents of the Vance-Owen peace plan. The Council
should now take all appropriate steps to ensure that the Bosnian Serb side
accepts the peace plan without further delay, thus paving the way for the
re-establishment of peace with justice and respect for human rights in Bosnia
and Herzegovina.
I cannot conclude this statement without paying my delegation's warmest
tribute to the splendid work performed by UNPROFOR in the most difficult of
circumstances.
Mr, ARAUJO CASTRO (Brazil): Brazil welcomes the adoption by the
Security Council of resolution 815 (1993).
The situation in many parts of the territory of the former Yugoslavia,
where the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) is currently deployed, is
still critical, and much remains to be done in the context of the peace talks
and by the United Nations, and mainly by the peoples directly involved, before
peace can be restored in that region.
My delegation takes this opportunity to pay tribute to the Co-Chairmen of
the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the Former
Yugoslavia, Mr. Vance and Lord Owen, whose untiring dedication and diplomatic
skills led to the assembly of a broad and well-crafted peace package, which
constitutes the best hope for attaining a negotiated solution to the conflict
in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We share the hope that the remaining party may
soon agree to that package so that work can start on its full implementation.
JRS/3/3961
S/PV.3189
14-15
(Mr. Arauio Castro, Brazil)
With the resolution we have just adopted, which extends the mandate of
UNPROFOR until 30 June 1993, the Security Council takes a limited but
important step forward in demonstrating the continued commitment of the
international community to the achievement of a lasting peace in all of the
territory of the former Yugoslavia.
Brazil contributes personnel to UNPROFOR and attaches special importance
to the fact that in the resolution adopted today the Security Council
reiterates its determination to ensure the security of UNPROFOR and its
freedom of movement. Under most trying and dangerous circumstances, UNPROFOR
personnel have given inspiring examples of courage and dedication.
We welcome the flexible time frame chosen with regard to UNPROFOR's
mandate, which provides for its possible review at any time in the light of
developments in the peace talks and the situation on the ground. The
desirability of this approach is evident, particularly taking into account the
sensitivity of the present stage of negotiations regarding the situation in
both Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In the next weeks the Security Council will probably be called upon to
take further important decisions in relation to the former Yugoslavia. It is
our hope that those decisions, like the one we have taken today, will play a
positive role in assisting the peoples now at war to rediscover the path to
peace and tolerance.
Mr. CHEN Jian (China) (interpretation from Chinese): Since the
Security Council adopted resolution 807 (1993), which extended UNPROFOR's
mandate for an interim period, armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia has
continued and the plight of the people continues. For this we express our
deep concern and sympathy.
S/PV.3189
16
JB/4/3965
(Mr. Chen Jian, China)
The Chinese delegation agrees with the analysis made by the
Secretary-General in the report he submitted pursuant to Security Council
resolution 807 (1993). We also agree with the Secretary-General's
recommendation that the UNPROFOR mandate be extended for three more months.
We support the principles contained in the resolution, particularly that of
ensuring the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Croatia.
The Chinese delegation supports the main thrust of the resolution the
Security Council has just adopted and voted in favour of it. However, the
Chinese delegation would like to reiterate its reservations concerning the
applicability of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter. It is our view
that the application of Chapter VII is due to the special and specific needs
of Croatia and should not constitute a precedent for the peace-keeping
operations of the United Nations. It is our hope that, in the coming three
months, all sides concerned will actively cooperate with and support the
efforts made by the two Co-Chairmen and that, through full consultation and
negotiation, they will resolve their existing differences so that real
progress can be made towards a peaceful solution of the question of the former
Yugoslavia.
The PRESIDENT: There are no further speakers inscribed on my list.
The Security Council has thus concluded the present stage of its consideration
of the item on its agenda.
The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.
The meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.
