(The President)
I shall now call on those members of the Council who wish to make
statements following the voting.
Mr■ WALKER (United States of America): My Government was gratified
that the Secretary-General endorsed the expansion of the United Nations
Protection Force in Macedonia, and we are pleased that the Council has adopted
this resolution as expeditiously as it has.
My Government's offer of forces for the United Nations contingent in the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is part of a larger effort to deal with
the conflict in the region. This expansion is an essential step in our goal
of promoting regional stability.
The Council's endorsement of this plan is evidence that the international
community can work together towards the prevention and resolution of conflict.
The PRESIDENT (interpretation from Spanish): There are no further
speakers inscribed on my list. The Security Council has thus concluded the
present stage of its consideration of the item on the agenda.
The Security Council will remain seized of the matter.
The meeting roseeat 3.35 p.m.
