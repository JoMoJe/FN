The Security Council is meeting in accordance with the understanding
reached in its prior consultations.
Following consultations among members of the Security Council, I have
been authorized to make the following statement on behalf of the Council:
"""The Security Council is deeply concerned to learn from the"
Secretary-General that the offensive by the Croatian armed forces
continues unabated in flagrant violation of resolution 802 (1993) of
25 January 1993, at a crucial time in the peace process.
"""The Council demands that military action by all parties and others"
concerned cease immediately. It further demands that all parties and
others concerned comply fully and immediately with all the provisions of
resolution 802 (1993) and with other relevant Security Council
resolutions.
"""The Council once again demands that all parties and others"
concerned respect fully the safety of United Nations personnel and
guarantee their freedom of movement. The Council reiterates that it will
hold the political and military leaders involved in the conflict
responsible and accountable for the safety of the United Nations
.peace-keeping personnel in the area.
